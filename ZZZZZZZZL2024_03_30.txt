Jul: 😳
Jul: Welcome back
Ishipwillowandhunter: that was strange. Anyways, did you know that everything is slowly drifting apart and one day even atoms willl be so far apart from each other that there might as well be nothing in the universe
Oofalladeez: no the universe will just be too large to comprehend
Oofalladeez: thats if we don't get torn apart and our species dies before then
Jul: I love you
Ishipwillowandhunter: we must be thinking of different things. The theory I'm thinking of literally says that every atom will be pushed apart until the space between them is so great that there is practically nothing 
Ishipwillowandhunter: but our species will definitely be dead beforehand 
Ishipwillowandhunter: we're pretty much just a cosmic blip, an accounting error. The time we occupy is nothing 
Ishipwillowandhunter: relatively speaking at least 
Dtrump: We can find a new planet.

Oofalladeez: I like izzy

Oofalladeez: but when you get to know her
Dtrump: It's weird when people who claim to hate me have asked for my help in the past.
Oofalladeez: she can be surprisingly serious
Oofalladeez: maybe its because whenever they get attacked you jump on the fuckin bandwagon
Raul_menendez: I had a friend in middle school who had mental breakdowns but it was easier to deal wit because it was irl. It just seems so different on a chat then it does irl
Inasg_no: Honestly I think it's easier online
Ishipwillowandhunter: What's easier online?
Dtrump: Wrong response.
Raul_menendez: not when you got one of the most shitist vlocab libaries
Inasg_no: helping people 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Imo it's harder. I can't give hugs or get water or have serious talks and iapwhaou
Inasg_no: yeah ik 
Inasg_no: But that bitch Holly I told you abt
Inasg_no: before all the drama
Inasg_no: She has a breakdown and I tried to help 
Inasg_no: but she's not a hugger
Inasg_no: She won't talk about things 
Dtrump: holly had golly big ass
Inasg_no: And she was js freaking out and I genuinely tried 
Inasg_no: Idk I find it easier online
09:39:39Saturday, March 30, 2024
Dtrump: If you were to diagnose me what would you give me?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Sometimes that happens. breakdowns aren't easy to deal with. When I'm seriously having trouble, not even breakdown level but close, I don't even get online. It's not any easier irl. I'd rather be there and try though
Raul_menendez: irl first I try to do is get them to control there breathing so the don't hyper ventilate and pass out then I just try talking to them a bit maybe get them some water if there any nearby
Raul_menendez: and just be a little therapist for her]
Dtrump: I saw rapist and got exited

Inasg_no: When you fought off all those feelings 
Inasg_no: You slept that night happy 
Inasg_no: You know you can do it
Izzy_blight: I think Trump is tired of this perfectly understandable
Ishipwillowandhunter: Izzy, it isn't your nature. You don't need to do it. You're not helping anything, you're not helping yourself, you're not even satisfying any need you think you have. It's pointless.
Inasg_no: Trump shut it
Izzy_blight: I I could yeah before I destroyed
Izzy_blight: Fox Fuck you Michael
Dtrump: Tay what should I say.
Izzy_blight: You don't

Ishipwillowandhunter: I say that like it's a drug
Jul: i said the same but then i missed you
Izzy_blight: Tonight has just about had it all I think. Promises were made and not kept, i contributed absolutely nothing and only brought myself yet another small step closer to alienating the only people in my life that I truly care about, and I dragged a bunch of terrible thoughts and feelings back to the forefront of my existence. I'm going to go to sleep now and hopefully not wake up
Jul: relatable lol goodnight
Ishipwillowandhunter: Goodnight Izzy, sorry for everything. And if this was really my only way to talk to you and one or two others then I'd stay but I have discord

Neko_yeetus: Instant pain relief 
Neko_yeetus: I’ve got stuff that numbs everything so quickly and it’s double strength as Orajel
Ishipwillowandhunter: Trump is half psychotic demented pervert, half kind sweet old man
Ishipwillowandhunter: oh? I want 20
Neko_yeetus: I imagine he’s just a little hampter 
Neko_yeetus: with a tiny little computer
Neko_yeetus: On a tiny desk
Neko_yeetus: Oh I feel so much better
Dtrump: I don't have a desk anymore.
Neko_yeetus: Okay so he’s on a tiny bed 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Aww. And he lives in a hole in the wall.
Neko_yeetus: Yes
Neko_yeetus: But it’s like a teenage boys room
Raul_menendez: wonder pets vibes

Izzy_blight: Someday we're all going to die
Neko_yeetus: Yessssssssss

Raul_menendez: the only time I watch puffer is either to get another pov on a video or to watch his meme ylyl challenges
Dtrump: oh 
Ishipwillowandhunter: True. I plan to die before the age of 40, I ain't gonna be an old man
Izzy_blight: Hhngggjjuiikklkjhnbfdcv

Ishipwillowandhunter: Mario Party is on his main channel
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't think he's streamed Mario Party ever
Raul_menendez: I just checked I don't see it
Neko_yeetus: Cause that’s gonna end in a way you don’t like that’s gonna cause you to be more upset
Izzy_blight: You ruined my life for two years and ignore me when I'm hurting. I think I have the right to talk to you however I want 
Neko_yeetus: No I didn’t I tried to help I’ve tried to help so much
Izzy_blight: I can't be much more upset than I am right now 
Neko_yeetus: It was what 3 years ago
Izzy_blight: That's why I'm acting like a horrible piece of shit
Izzy_blight: Oh fuck you

Raul_menendez: you to mich
Neko_yeetus: Mich doesn’t sleep
Rogue: idk izzy has some deep feelings about rejection, but its not your responsibility to always cater to them
Dtrump: Izzy is a roller coastee
Ishipwillowandhunter: You didn't do anything wrong, AJ. You can't prevent her from feeling like this
Neko_yeetus: Also I wasn’t put in a home, my siblings were taken because my mother neglected them and did meth with one of her 3 baby daddies

09:02:05Monday, April 1, 2024
Rogue: bruh get your eyes off the screen its making it worse
Raul_menendez: take some meatonine
Izzy_blight: My bpd instincts are telling me I should act all self righteous, like nobody understands me and nobody is who i thought they were and everyone is against me. But that's all bullshit. Delusion s of a sad childish broken mind. I'm angry but the only person i should be angry at is me. This is all i do. I hurt and i destroy and then try to act like everything is everyone else s fault
Raul_menendez: melatonine
Neko_yeetus: I don’t have any
Dtrump: melanin
Neko_yeetus: I have 0 melanin
Raul_menendez: hmm so ur over powering your   instincts?
Neko_yeetus: I’m not ignoring you Izzy I just don’t know what to say love
Dtrump: oh melantonin
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yeah, me neither. I'm sorry but it's that point in the night where I'm basically a zombie, I just know useless shit like red rose lore
Izzy_blight: I should leave now in shame and never come back. I dont know why I can't. Well actually i do know. Or. Wjatever,
Ishipwillowandhunter: I wish I could ban you, it would do you a lot of good
Ishipwillowandhunter: some minor bad but a lot of good
Neko_yeetus: Contacting azala
Neko_yeetus: He can do it
Raul_menendez: isa go to bed 
Neko_yeetus: You need to sleep 
Neko_yeetus: Go eepy
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm starting to wonder why I selected this skin as a fetus. I don't like it but there are no gta5 barbershops near me
Neko_yeetus: That
Neko_yeetus: I don’t like that
Izzy_blight: You sound like my dad
Izzy_blight: Sleep isnt my problem 
Ishipwillowandhunter: eh I mean
Izzy_blight: I have a lot of other problems with who i am as a person 
Ishipwillowandhunter: You need a diagnosis and medication 
Raul_menendez: 
"Neko_yeetus: Go eepy"
Izzy_blight: Thank you for your expert opinion 
Raul_menendez: you need to go to the fucking professional i've showed you over 50 times
Neko_yeetus: Izzy if you are going to be mean we are not going to help
Neko_yeetus: We’ve given you sources
Izzy_blight: I'm mean when I need help.
Neko_yeetus: Try them
Neko_yeetus: WE ARE HELPING YOU
Neko_yeetus: Ugh
Ishipwillowandhunter: yes there was that therapy thing last night
Ishipwillowandhunter: trying to help anyways
Neko_yeetus: I actually give up
Ishipwillowandhunter: You need professionals 
Ishipwillowandhunter: This site is not good for you
Ishipwillowandhunter: literally anything could cause you to go mental homelander 
Izzy_blight: I gave up long ago 
Ishipwillowandhunter: us giving words of encouragment andtelling you to do this or that
Ishipwillowandhunter: is like throwing water balloons at a tank as it rolls through your 90 person village
Izzy_blight: Good to know everyone i love is just as fed up with me as i am
Rogue: tough love izzy, these people care about you
Izzy_blight: Fuck you
Izzy_blight: Sorry 
Neko_yeetus: If you stopped saying we aren’t helping and start using the things we give you to help things would probably be much easier love 
Raul_menendez: that was rude that's the first thing he said
Ishipwillowandhunter: see that was just unnecessary rogue didn't do anything at all
Neko_yeetus: Izzy you have the ability to not say words
Raul_menendez: hey isa what YouTuber do you watch?
Neko_yeetus: Sorry doesn’t work when you don’t change your behavior
Izzy_blight: You don't know how this feels 
Neko_yeetus: Oh really?
Izzy_blight: If you did you wouldn't
Ishipwillowandhunter: Doesn't she also have BPD, Izzy?
Raul_menendez: help?
Neko_yeetus: I’m medicated 
Neko_yeetus: That’s all
Ishipwillowandhunter: the difference between you and her is that she actually got help
Ishipwillowandhunter: I know it's not that easy for you
Raul_menendez: neko does have bpd but neko had meds for it
Izzy_blight: It's an undiagnosed mood disorder
Izzy_blight: No confirmation 
Neko_yeetus: Wow okay
Neko_yeetus: That actually
Neko_yeetus: Idk
Ishipwillowandhunter: Do you have confirmation?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Have you been diagnosed, Izzy?
Neko_yeetus: That’s so hypocritical 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just saying
Izzy_blight: I'm such a piece of shit i know
Neko_yeetus: And it hurts a little and idk why 
Izzy_blight: I
Neko_yeetus: But whatever no I’m not fully diagnosed
Neko_yeetus: But you aren’t diagnosed at all
Izzy_blight: Things just come out of my mouth by instinct
Raul_menendez: psychiatrist, psychologist or other trained mental health professional. those are people who can help when you get a conformation on your bpd
Neko_yeetus: You assume you have bpd because the symptoms you have
Neko_yeetus: And that’s valid
Izzy_blight: I have like every symptom
Neko_yeetus: I do the same with slightly more conformation bf that’s not valid?
Neko_yeetus: But*
Dtrump: thighs
Raul_menendez: ggn guys isa mich plz rest
Neko_yeetus: Good night love :)
Neko_yeetus: It was fun talking to you
Izzy_blight: The things i say really don't mean much.i just say whatever my brain tells me I should. I don't think about it
Neko_yeetus: Well you should
Izzy_blight: Yeah
Izzy_blight: No shit
Neko_yeetus: Because we have feelings too. Things you say hurt
Izzy_blight: Well don't take them seriously then. Easy. See how much of a copout that is?
Neko_yeetus: I think I’m done talking to you
Izzy_blight: Yeah I'm awful I'm so sorry 
Neko_yeetus: Maybe if you can calm down and maybe take a couple days to stay off this site
Ishipwillowandhunter: I've tried to get her to take days off this site and she can't. I wish she could. And you can't just not take shit seriously
Neko_yeetus: Yea ik 
Neko_yeetus: I’m just tired of this
Izzy_blight: Me too
Izzy_blight: Yes I know Michael 
Izzy_blight: I was mocking the
Izzy_blight: Oh never mind 
Neko_yeetus: I just want
Neko_yeetus: I want to be here to feel better
Izzy_blight: Me too
Neko_yeetus: Because without talking I feel alone 
Neko_yeetus: And feeling alone for me makes me do bad things
Neko_yeetus: Very bad things and have very very bad thoughts 
Izzy_blight: Fuck
Izzy_blight: I'm 
Izzy_blight: I'm such a failure 
Neko_yeetus: This site is my escape and Izzy I miss talking to you so much
09:23:43Monday, April 1, 2024
Neko_yeetus: Ik things may never be the way they were 
Neko_yeetus: But I just miss being able to make jokes with you 
Neko_yeetus: I’m sorry I hurt you
Neko_yeetus: I’m so so sorry
Izzy_blight: I just want to. To be able to help you guys and be good to you. It's my own fault i can't 
Neko_yeetus: You need to try them izzy
Izzy_blight: I'm a problem that refuses to be solved
Neko_yeetus: You need to find something
Neko_yeetus: Or someone 
Neko_yeetus: Anything
Izzy_blight: I had something 
Neko_yeetus: And use it as motivation to better yourself 
Izzy_blight: I took it away from myself for no reason 
Dtrump: meatballs
Izzy_blight: You were my motivation once
Izzy_blight: That was a long time ago 
Neko_yeetus: :/
Izzy_blight: I'm afraid I'm even weaker of spirit now than i was then
Rogue: If holding on to old memories only hurts, its time for new ones
Izzy_blight: It's not that easy for me 
Izzy_blight: I remember everything. I've got a good memory 
Izzy_blight: And nothing about me is good other than that 
Neko_yeetus: This is the first time I’ve cried in a very very long time
Neko_yeetus: I hate that you think that about yourself izzy
Izzy_blight: I'm sorry. I
Neko_yeetus: I know you mean no harm to anyone…you are a kind soul…I wish you’d realize how truly amazing you are 
Neko_yeetus: Everyone has flaws
Izzy_blight: I. I'm crying now too usually only my dad can make me cry when he gets mad at me 
Neko_yeetus: This roadblock you have hit is only temporary my love
Neko_yeetus: If you would let me, let all of us help you through it then I’ll be with you for as long as I can every step of the way
Neko_yeetus: But you have to try
Neko_yeetus: We can’t carry you around it, you have to walk with is
Neko_yeetus: Us*
Dtrump: whose fault
Izzy_blight: I. I'm afraid
Izzy_blight: I'm afraid of many things. I'm such a coward 
Neko_yeetus: I know love…you are not a coward
Ishipwillowandhunter: You aren't a coward. This isn't something that's easy to deal with.
Neko_yeetus: It’s reasonable to be scared
Dtrump: I found you coward.
Ishipwillowandhunter: You can't expect yourself to fae everything, to do everything perfectly
Neko_yeetus: You’re brain is so full of thoughts that you hate and you don’t feel in control of them and that’s so hard and the fact that you are still going is such an amazing thing
Izzy_blight: Ii don't know why suddenly everyone is so understanding but I can't stopcrying
Izzy_blight: I am not worthy
Neko_yeetus: Because I was mad, and then I realized what I was doing and it wasn’t good. 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I was a wee bit upset with you and myself. We're trying. You're trying. 
Dtrump: Your so anal about this.
Izzy_blight: Sorry. I'm sorry 
Izzy_blight: I shouldnt have said all th things i said

10:07:01Monday, April 1, 2024
Izzy_blight: Hello son. I'm sorry 
Izzy_blight: sorry is worthless I wish I could do something 
Ishipwillowandhunter: yes hi. It's alright. You dont' need to do anything.
Izzy_blight: I do. I need to. I will. Somehow 
Izzy_blight: I reel light headed 
Inasg_no: Wb
Izzy_blight: Oh fujmmnh
Ishipwillowandhunter: Thank you. There's nothing to be done Izzy. I'm sorry for tonight. And every night in the past month. 
Izzy_blight: That means...surprisingly a lot. Im sorry too
Inasg_no: tf did I miss
Izzy_blight: Nothing. Typical drama caused by me
Ishipwillowandhunter: Pretty much nothing, just regular stuff but I feel worse for Izzy and the situation now than ever
Izzy_blight: Nothing to feel bad for me about. I'm just a terrible trash bin and thats the extent of the issue 
Izzy_blight: Sorry i know that's not true but that's the first thing my brain pushes out of my mouth 
Ishipwillowandhunter: you aren't. You are dealing with a very difficult thing and I need to be more understanding sometimes. However right now I am unable to do most anything
Izzy_blight: I know. i demand everything from people who can't afford to give anything a lot of the time. Or don't even know what to really give 
Ishipwillowandhunter: No, I'm sorry. I'm meaning that I'm so tired and emotionally dead right now that I am unable to offer literally anything 
Izzy_blight: No i. I know. What you offered 20 minutes ago and what you're offering now is exactly what i need. It's enough and far more than i deserve 
Izzy_blight: I'm sorry I just want to take the pain away 
Izzy_blight: Give it to me i will eat it and Jimmy will feel it because we are linked
10:28:40Monday, April 1, 2024
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm sorry I'm going to need 15 minutes. i can't just give me a bit

Rogue: its quite alright really
Izzy_blight: No it's not 
Izzy_blight: Everyone always says that butits not
Izzy_blight: I wish I was different but its too hard to change 
Rogue: I know
Rogue: Its like that for highly necrotic minds
Rogue: neurotic*
Izzy_blight: I need a brain wash. I think I've cried more tonight than i have in months
Rogue: thats good tho, dont hate it
Izzy_blight: I hate everything that led up to it. I said horrible things i would never say. I felt so hopeless. I
Izzy_blight: I think I'm asout to start again 
Dtrump: highly gay
Izzy_blight: Darn right

Ishipwillowandhunter: Thank you 
Izzy_blight: Hello.hope you re well
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh im fine. It seems you're not and I'm sorry. Can I do anything?
Izzy_blight: You've done enough. I'm ok. I just. I really hate myself rightnow and I can't stop crying 
Izzy_blight: Its the good kind of crying though I'm crying because i was given kindness when i did not deserve it and it helped my soul
10:50:19Monday, April 1, 2024
Ishipwillowandhunter: Poor baby. I'm sorry sweetheart. You've done nothing wrong. It isn't but fault you feel or act the way you do and you certainly cant be blamed forgetting angry about it.
Rogue: wholesome thoughts 
Rogue: man it feels good staying in on a monday morning
Izzy_blight: You just made me cry harder and it's th e best thank you. I'm just. With everyone ganging on me and nothing i could do but get more and more upset. I genuinely lost all hope for a few minutes back there. I haven't cut in like maybe a month or two. I had to get pushed pretty far to do that 
Dtrump: are you gook
Izzy_blight: Sorry good thoughts. I like birds
Izzy_blight: Yes
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm so very sorry I couldn't prevent that. Fucking hell.
Izzy_blight: You were upset, i was upset aj was upset no one was in their right mind 
Izzy_blight: I'm sorry i got us to that point 
Ishipwillowandhunter: It wasn't you. You didn't do anything, yeah? You were already upset and didn't help in the slightest 
Izzy_blight: I was upset and made everyone else upset. I started being mean and rude for no reason
Dtrump: ahh still unsolved
Ishipwillowandhunter: It was insensitivity, mine, that I think got you there
Izzy_blight: Unsolved mysteries: why does Jimmy have such a large basement 
Izzy_blight: Uh it was one particular thing you said that set me off. And then AJ made the mistake of responding to me with anything other than the deepest affection for my petulant self
11:11:58Monday, April 1, 2024
Rogue: damn feelings ruining everything 
Dtrump: move on simple
Izzy_blight: Indeed. Yes donny i will certainly try
Dtrump: The people you meet in real life are better people anyways.
Izzy_blight: Unfortunately i don't have the self confidence to go out and meet people. Heck it's super hard for me to even meet new people online 
Rogue: now that I can relate with
Izzy_blight: This is the only place I have any social confidence cause ive been here for like 5 years and it feels familiar
Izzy_blight: Social disability club! It's not a fun club but welcome

Inasg_no: So dont judge
Dtrump: 13 hours awake
Inasg_no: i want to do something but they're all rlly tired cuz they stayed up late and ugh
Inasg_no: I saw a bunch of rapists in the park yesterday 
Inasg_no: I'm telling you they're racist 
Inasg_no: They literally were dressed in all black on bikes with vapes
Inasg_no: And they js stopped and stared at us for ages 
Inasg_no: Rapists. 
Inasg_no: Then later we got into an argument with some freaking 10 year olds who were acting tough which was hilarious 
Dtrump: I act 10
Ishipwillowandhunter: lmao they sound like wannabe tough guys, not rapists 
Izzy_blight: Hey I'm back How are things
Ishipwillowandhunter: also you're right, I can't see very well but I can see your face so I'm happy
Inasg_no: I don't care I'm telling you if it was dark they were
Inasg_no: Awwww
Ishipwillowandhunter: Welcome back love <3 not much has happened
Inasg_no: you can't really 
Inasg_no: Hi izzaline
Ishipwillowandhunter: They argued with 10 year old girls. I doubt they're like that. Also I forgot the other thing you said. My memory faded with age
Izzy_blight: Hi Jimmy
Izzy_blight: Sorry I'm a little
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh I just realized I never shared with you updated chapter. I did that like 3/4 days ago. Is now a bad time?
Inasg_no: What no no
Inasg_no: Nvm goose 
Dtrump: that's me
Ishipwillowandhunter: Wait what
Inasg_no: you have it all confused 
Inasg_no: nevermind 👍🏼
Inasg_no: hi trumptytrump 
Izzy_blight: It's certainly a time
Ishipwillowandhunter: ooh.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Are you okay sweetheart?
Izzy_blight: Go ahead if you like
Ishipwillowandhunter: If you're not in an okay mood I'd rather focus on that, Izzy
Dtrump: ok that was pregame
Izzy_blight: Oh me I'm fine I'm just. I don't know
Izzy_blight: Sorry
Ishipwillowandhunter: Are you sure? Nothing to be sorry for, I get it <3
Inasg_no: On another note, we went to Tesco and somehow I found a warehouse in the lift it was really confusing I was freaking out, but then I found another one and I was like what the actual fuck cuz it was all clothes before but yeah figured it out after 
Ishipwillowandhunter: What
Ishipwillowandhunter: what freaked you out
Dtrump: Tesco is off brand costco
Inasg_no: So it was a normal lift you know
Inasg_no: Then when I went in alone 
Inasg_no: It opened up to a warehouse 
Inasg_no: Instead of clothes 
Inasg_no: So I pressed the next level
Inasg_no: There were only 2
Inasg_no: And it was another warehouse 
Izzy_blight: I'm I'm I'm Jimmy. Yes. Sorry for for for sorry
Dtrump: oh secret sex rooms
Izzy_blight: Old clothes put in mouth
Rina: Yo 
Rina: Why are ya'll even up fr
Izzy_blight: I don't know. Sport, I guess
Dtrump: I have a wacky schedule.
Ishipwillowandhunter: I have no schedule and unrelenting sadness
Ishipwillowandhunter: And ngl Tay
Ishipwillowandhunter: if that happened to me
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'd iprobably think I got transported somewhere
Ishipwillowandhunter: and my dumbass would get off the elevator 
Inasg_no: I couldn't 
Inasg_no: Cuz it only opened up to warehouses
Ishipwillowandhunter: Exactly
Ishipwillowandhunter: if I tried twice
Ishipwillowandhunter: multiple times, whatever
Ishipwillowandhunter: and it was still a warehouse
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'd step off
Inasg_no: Into the warehouse?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yes
Inasg_no: I was going to
Inasg_no: But then somehow 
Izzy_blight: ;[
Inasg_no: The other side of the lift 
Inasg_no: Opened
Inasg_no: And some creepy guy
Inasg_no: Told me I can't be there
Inasg_no: But
Inasg_no: That side
Inasg_no: Had all the normal shop
Inasg_no: So I was okay 👍🏼
Dtrump: I know I'm creepy.
Inasg_no: That was my lift journey 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Ooh I see
08:43:40Tuesday, April 2, 2024
Ishipwillowandhunter: yeah no if a creepy man stepped into an elevator with me and told me I wasn't supposed to be somewhere i would either immediately want to be there or I would accept my fate as a victim to a secret serial killer
Dtrump: oh you
Inasg_no: Lmfao
Inasg_no: I think it was for goods only
Inasg_no: Cuz the lift said goods only
Dtrump: That would tempt me.
Ishipwillowandhunter: why did you take it then?
Dtrump: She thought goods meant drugs.
Inasg_no: I didn't think much about it
Inasg_no: It's what we took up
Inasg_no: Quite ironic as the customer lift was next to us saying customer lift 
Ishipwillowandhunter: .
Ishipwillowandhunter: sorry back, anyone say anything
Izzy_blight: Hi welcome nothing really
Ishipwillowandhunter: thank you. I'm tired. I'll be getting sleep in an hour or two
Izzy_blight: Very good
Inasg_no: Wbb 
Izzy_blight: I love you son
Ishipwillowandhunter: tyy
Ishipwillowandhunter: I love you more <3
Izzy_blight: My hands are bleeding and hurting again Would it be okay if I went and put some lotion on them in like 20 minutes
09:02:02Tuesday, April 2, 2024
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yes, no please go do it now
Izzy_blight: Of course. Sorry I just always feel like I haveto ask for permission to be able to end my own suffering
Ishipwillowandhunter: I wish I had a constant eye on you I hate that
Izzy_blight: I guess now you know how I feel but I wish you you didn't i'm I'm sorry
Izzy_blight: But my hands feel better already so thank youfor that
Ishipwillowandhunter: Don't be sorry, it's okay. I'm glad they're feeling better.
Izzy_blight: Yes. I'm. I feel like saying something that I know isn't true
Izzy_blight: My my brain is acting funny again
Izzy_blight: real funny and silly
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm going to kiss it and say sweet things to it until it liquefies and then we will conquer the world
Ishipwillowandhunter: I also find it dumb that liquefy is not liquify 
Izzy_blight: Perfection. Wait it isn't? Have I been spelling it wrong my whole life
Izzy_blight: Is there a lore reason? Am I stupid
Ishipwillowandhunter: It's probably because of some stupid reason. English comes from Germanic languages which often come from Latin so liquefy is probably a word or derivative of a word from one of those languages. I could be wrong though, English is just a dumbass language 
Inasg_no: That's hot 
Izzy_blight: English is like three other languages in a trench coat pretending to be one language
Ishipwillowandhunter: What is?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh, yes it absolutely is. English is like one language speaking another language in the accent of a third language. 
Izzy_blight: It's an absolute mess and it's one of the most spoken languages in the world
Izzy_blight: How beautiful
Izzy_blight: I'm I'm just glad it's my first language and not I haven't had to learn it from the perspective of a foreigner Because I imagine it's really it's really hard
09:20:23Tuesday, April 2, 2024
Ishipwillowandhunter: Whenever I get frustrated with English I just think to myself that it could be French. French makes absolutely no sense.
Izzy_blight: I've heard French is one of the easiest languages for native English speakers to learn. Which probably isn't a good sign
Ishipwillowandhunter: Is it? Is it really? There are no rules
Inasg_no: If you can learn french you can learn Spanish and Italian
Ishipwillowandhunter: Or, there are rules
Ishipwillowandhunter: But they make absolutely no fucking sense
Ishipwillowandhunter: You have 6 vowels instead of 5??
Inasg_no: Dutch is the easiest for an English speaker to learn though 
Ishipwillowandhunter: You can use 3 vowels to make up an entire word and yet not pronounce a single one of those vowels the way they're meant to be pronounced
Izzy_blight: Linguistics sure are funny
Ishipwillowandhunter: adjectives go after nouns, color adjectives, and don't even get me fucking started on la, l’a and là. Fuck.
Izzy_blight: Yeah that sounds horrible. and surprisingly a lot like English
Ishipwillowandhunter: Spanish is much, much easier to learn than French in my opinion
Inasg_no: well um some how adjectives don't go after nouns just saying 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Italian is admittedly pretty hard 
Inasg_no: Like 
Inasg_no: Age
Ishipwillowandhunter: but
Inasg_no: And 
Inasg_no: Size 
Inasg_no: Go before 
Ishipwillowandhunter: awuihaorag
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm going to shoot all of France.
Ishipwillowandhunter: They're going to die.
Inasg_no: My cousin's are in France 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm going to burn every book on the French there is.
Inasg_no: Bruh
Ishipwillowandhunter: The language will be lost ti time.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Good.
Ishipwillowandhunter: If your cousins chose to live there they deserve it
Izzy_blight: God I hate the French. Who's idea was it to recreate this neo-gothic nightmare
Inasg_no: I'll go with them 😔
Ishipwillowandhunter: Thank you Izzy
Ishipwillowandhunter: Then that's your choice -_-
Inasg_no: bruh
Dtrump: ok
Ishipwillowandhunter: I've been trying vocal training recently 
Ishipwillowandhunter: not for singing though
Izzy_blight: I hope you haven't been using a method that hurts your throat
Izzy_blight: I tried one of those and it wasn't so good
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yeah, the swallow method kinda hurt so I stopped doing that. I'm trying to increase/decrease pitch, make it so I can have a heavier vocal weight, you know
Inasg_no: Hot
Dtrump: swallow method pause
Izzy_blight: Yeah that one can cause actual throat damage so I wouldn't advise it. Very good, i hope it works out well for you. I admit I've been neglecting mine recently I should probably get back on it
Dtrump: I'm giggling like a schoolgirl rn.
Izzy_blight: Silly little porcupine
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yeah, I read up a bit on that. According to most it isn't actually that harmful, it helps build up muscle in that area but overdoing it can temporarily damage your throat just like any vocal exercise. 
09:38:45Tuesday, April 2, 2024
Ishipwillowandhunter: Like, at first, you're probably not going to beable to speak much because it's preventing you from breathing, kinda, but your larynx can raise to a higher position with training. I'm not sure how well it works for everyone and how successful it is but yeah. You know Druew? He does voice trolling and learned using the swallow method
Izzy_blight: Ah i see. I i fed in about that sometime back. I have one method that I like right now, I haven't really been a huge fan of most of the othersI've found
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh? What's the method?
Izzy_blight: I learned it from this Australian girl
Izzy_blight: I'll try to guess grab it as me best I can I'm not good at this driving things
Izzy_blight: Jesus Christ what is going on with this thing
Izzy_blight: You like. Actually I just I just realized I kind of forgot what it is i haven't actually turn it in like a couple of weeks
Izzy_blight: I'm I'm going to go see if I can find the video again where I learned it
Ishipwillowandhunter: If you do find the video please share it with mee
Izzy_blight: of course. It's very basic, more of a beginning method then anything I I think but my results with it were surprisingly good
Ishipwillowandhunter: Beginner method for a beginner, fine with me. Thank you <3
Izzy_blight: All right I found a hero
Izzy_blight: Bro what is up with you You know what whatever
Izzy_blight: Here you go I found it
Izzy_blight: https://youtu.be/5aCDuzN0lds?t=123
09:57:08Tuesday, April 2, 2024
Izzy_blight: It feels like like my speech text has been performing a lot worse the last couple gays or maybe my voice just got worse which is probably what happened
Dtrump: pred
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't think that's it at all. It should work regardless. And thank you, I'll definitely be using in the days to come.
Izzy_blight: I think Jimmy broke it. You welcome i'm glad to have been of assistance, I was able to achieve pretty much exactly the voice I I wanted after practicing for only one night with it
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh wow. I doubt I'll be able to do it in one night but if it's that good then I'm sure it'll work. 
Izzy_blight: I haven't really done it a lot since then and i forgot how to do the voice I like so I'm going to have to relearn it, cons of being lazy. But it was so easy the first time I don't think I'll have much of an issue. I don't know maybe It was just a fluke
Izzy_blight: I'm believe in you Jimmy you're the best you got it
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't think it was a fluke, voices are not easy to do. I htink you'll get it pretty easily.
Izzy_blight: Yay thank you i'm I hope will. I think I might half on the edge of passing out
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm right there with you. I'm going to go in an hour or less I think
Izzy_blight: That would be good i wish i could give you my best teddy bear
Dtrump: there was bird in my house wtf
Ishipwillowandhunter: Uh bird? Bird is the word?
Dtrump: my cat almost ate it too
10:15:30Tuesday, April 2, 2024
Izzy_blight: Oh well a bird bird bird The bird is the word a whale a bird bird bird and the bird is the word November bird bird bird bird birds a word
Izzy_blight: Oh well don't you know about the bird Everybody's heard about the bird
Izzy_blight: Where did November come from
Chefcooning: Chat
Inasg_no: No.
Chefcooning: Yes
Inasg_no: No
Chefcooning: Finish it
Inasg_no: Finish what
Izzy_blight: The war
Ishipwillowandhunter: It's Latin. The roman calender had 10 months instead of 12 and the 9th month was November. Novem is 9 in Latin
Izzy_blight: Very clever
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yes. Latin is strange though. Complicated and hard to learn, various systems. For some reason not all the months are named after numbers like you think. Just septem (7) to decem (10). But like january was named avter a god. so idk what they were thinking
Izzy_blight: Maybe they weren't thinking at all and had no brain
Ishipwillowandhunter: I think the greeks and romans thought too much. their philosophers were someting else
Izzy_blight: Who was that one guy
Izzy_blight: Diogenes
Izzy_blight: Like that that weird guy who lived who lived in a barrel
Izzy_blight: I like that guy That guy was cool
Rogue: histories first troll
Izzy_blight: Absolute legend
Rogue: they all were
Dtrump: archimedes
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yes, he was great and very bold but also very strange. Like the time plato called humans "featherless bipeds" so he plucked a chicken and said "this is a man". Or the time he got caught masturbating in public and said "if only I could rub my bully to relieve my hunger"
Dtrump: Donald Trump was also cool back than.
Izzy_blight: He's mildly chaotic
Izzy_blight: I have great respect for a bit of chaos in a man
Inasg_no: MY GIDSSSSSSSS
Ishipwillowandhunter: yes I love it so much
10:33:53Tuesday, April 2, 2024
Izzy_blight: I love you so much
Izzy_blight: i I'm I'm really tired
Izzy_blight: Can we hug and then go in a box
Ishipwillowandhunter: Awww. I love you more. I want to sleep soon yes. Let's cuddle in a bonfire 
Rogue: comfy
Rogue: since when do you own me tay
Izzy_blight: mmm Warming toasty. I want to feel like a marshmallow. Yes yes very very very good small and fluffy
Izzy_blight: I want gloves with warmer flaps
Inasg_no: since always 
Dtrump: every try to catch a bird
Rogue: I thought slavery was dead in africa :p
Inasg_no: 😕
Ishipwillowandhunter: Is it? I thought slavery was alive and well
Rogue: yeah sadly thats true
Izzy_blight: uh
Izzy_blight: Jimmy
Izzy_blight: Saved it
Dtrump: I have slaves still
Inasg_no: I'm your slave
Dtrump: cant say that
Inasg_no:  😔

Neko_yeetus: No I did not kill her
Rogue: explain yourself
Neko_yeetus: Oh oops I’m playing cyberpunk
Rogue: oh lol you had me
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm late to it but most girls have stretch marks past a certain age, nothing wrong with it at all. They are marks of lighting, pure power being used to contain the all powerful hellspawn within you that threatens to 76.2% of all known life because of a 2.3 billion year old grudge. Also if you're going to carry a dead body make sure it's dead because of you
Izzy_blight: I want to buy one of those James Sunderland army jackets but I think a well-made replica costs like a few hundred bucks from what I remember
Neko_yeetus: Hmm
Ishipwillowandhunter: I say hellspawn lovingly, heaven has enough lights as is. I can't wait to become Satan's vessel 
Neko_yeetus: Holy shit anal beads in cyberpunk

Izzy_blight: Sorry I'm getting selfish again I'll be quiet
Ishipwillowandhunter: oh sorry
Dtrump: srry
Izzy_blight: Yeah you're sorry whatever
Izzy_blight: It's nice to know how easily I'm forgotten
Ishipwillowandhunter: It was just a passing comment, I thought nothing of it. I should've. very sorry
Izzy_blight: oh fucking hell I'm I'm doing it again i just said I'd be quiet

Izzy_blight: His laundry
Izzy_blight: He's been wearing the same dirty clothes for the last 57 years

Lazurus: sorry kids
Izzy_blight: Im incapable of doing that sorry
Lazurus: its just in your blood huh lol
Izzy_blight: Yes i  have an annoying degree of empathy
Lazurus: I have an annoying lack of that
Izzy_blight: Many people here do
Izzy_blight: I dont fit in here very well 
Lazurus: that sounds about right tbh
Lazurus: no one fits in here unless their crazy or just constantly horny
Lazurus: or both
Dtrump: I'm never horny
Izzy_blight: I'm both. I just prefer not to show my own sexuality because i have an ounce of decorum
Izzy_blight: And I'm crazy in a way that doesn't mix well with the typical type of crazy here
Lazurus: true and trump that's a lie
Ishipwillowandhunter: I am almost never horny, despite how i act most of the time. I am crazy in my own special snowflake way though
Lazurus: cute but most snowflakes get their icey hearts melted
Ishipwillowandhunter: Have to have a heart to melt
Lazurus: well if your still breathing you've got a heart somewhere lol
Dtrump: sentisve cock
Lazurus: yes trump I can nut by being touch so?
Lazurus: I've got to stop talking like that on here
Cocknose: cum
Lazurus: I cant anymore I'm dry
Dtrump: cocknose
Lazurus: my fav clown
Cocknose: cumnose
Lazurus: ah his lil sidekick lol
Cocknose: sidecum
Lazurus: I wonder how many ips I have to post on here for this website to get taken down
Izzy_blight: My repressed hypersexuality would be welcome here. But this place doesn't need any more of that crap and id rather die than let it out
Lazurus: aww damn no one wants to join me on the horny side🥲
Ishipwillowandhunter: I often find myself in weird situations because of my fake horny. I can act and say super horny things but I don't like actually being horny
Izzy_blight: I fucking hate that.
Izzy_blight: I know exactly what you mean too cause the same has happened to me 
Lazurus: I can say that is true
Izzy_blight: Stressful thoughts are being compounded.i hate my life
Lazurus: hmm it sounds like you need to watch a good movie or read a good book
Lazurus: get your mind off things ya know
Izzy_blight: No use. i can never escape . I try
Lazurus: Jimmy always take you back to his rape shack huh
Izzy_blight: Things i hate are always in the back of my mind 
Izzy_blight: My brain loves to torture eme over things that dont matter to anybody but me
Lazurus: yeah that does sound like a problem
Izzy_blight: It's a profound and hopeless kind of loneliness. I can never tell anyone what s really wrong cause no one else would get it
Lazurus: I'm sorry you have to deal with that
Izzy_blight: I'm sorry too because it makes me a real miserable piece of shit to be around 
Lazurus: hey you may be miserable but your not a piece of shit and your pretty fun to be around tbh
Izzy_blight: Fuck yes i am and fuck no im not. Ask michael or aj, they can tell you. they see the worst of me 
Lazurus: I'm sorry you feel that way about yourself but your only lying to yourself Hun
Izzy_blight: I know myself, better than anyone. I'm a childish self centered control freak with serious emotional problems
Lazurus: well problems are fun
Ishipwillowandhunter: sorry back
Ishipwillowandhunter: .
Izzy_blight: Oh absolutely not
Lazurus: and besides its not like their aren't people who like being controlled
Ishipwillowandhunter: oops
Lazurus: hey mich getter they sad
Ishipwillowandhunter: wha?
Izzy_blight: Uh
Lazurus: and I'm not mentally stable enough to play therapist
Lazurus: I'd do more harm than good tbh
Ishipwillowandhunter: and you think I am? Im having trouble convincing myself to go through with tomorrow, i doubt I can help much
Lazurus: so were all in the same boat yet its full of holes
Izzy_blight: We're patients in a hospital where all the doctors have left
Ishipwillowandhunter: my problem is I don't think I actually want to die
Ishipwillowandhunter: I mean i'd be fine with it
Ishipwillowandhunter: but there's a lot I want to do
Ishipwillowandhunter: have
Izzy_blight: That's not a problem 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I want to slit my wrists but live so there's no other option but for me to get help.
Lazurus: that's you realizing your not actually suicidal your just ok with death
Izzy_blight: Fuck
Ishipwillowandhunter: I want my dad to realize he needs to throw himself off the nearest cliff, is all
Izzy_blight: I am not in the mood for this. Yes he does 
Lazurus: and that's you realizing that you need help and that's you realizing you have daddy issues
Izzy_blight: I will throw him
Ishipwillowandhunter: lmao this goes beyond some daddy issues
Ishipwillowandhunter: and sorrry Izzy
Lazurus: ok I'll gib you dat one
Izzy_blight: It certainly does 
Izzy_blight: No i didnt mean it like that. I'm sorry 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don'tk now what's going on
Ishipwillowandhunter: part of me wants to continue ignoring here
Ishipwillowandhunter: but part of me feels too bad to now
Izzy_blight: I don't know either but i don't like it.do whatever makes you feel best.im sorry 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm not sure what would make me feel best
Ishipwillowandhunter: I know what would be best for you though
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm sorry love
Izzy_blight: Do you? I. I love yoyim sorry for being bad and sad and stupid 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yes. I go and avoid saying anything that might make things worse for you. i love you more, you've not done anything honey
Izzy_blight: Yes. but. I'm. My brain feels congested. Too much thought feeling. i can't speak 
Dtrump: or uou dont
Lazurus: huh
Lazurus: trump make my brain ache
Dtrump: I came 
Lazurus: well don't waste it drink it
Dtrump: jk
Lazurus: sorry I'll shut up
Izzy_blight: I used to be so much more fun. I was manically depressed in a more entertaining and less stifling way. Now im just a sad little snowflake who has to be coddled and tiptoed around because my shattered mind and ego are more sensitive and delicate than a wet paper towel 
Lazurus: https://img.ifunny.co/videos/ccedc779683f65f2292a27fdd678b74ee097494b6cb685cd83b2e2065da0f98c_1.mp4
Lazurus: I'm sorry to ruin the mood but I just found this again and had to share it
Izzy_blight: Theres no mood, im just talking to myself.very good 
Lazurus: oh mich left ya with the crazys alone again huh
Ishipwillowandhunter: Sorry, no. I mean kinda. I'm not sure what I'm doing.
Lazurus: you drink the forget juice or sum
Izzy_blight: Lazarus pit. be nice 
Izzy_blight: sorry 
Lazurus: I'll shut up
Lazurus: nah your good that was outta pocket
Dtrump: be nice 
Lazurus: fine OWO
Lazurus: I'll go back to being horny instead of sad
Ishipwillowandhunter: I drank some juice but I think it was old
Izzy_blight: I hate telling people how they should act or what i think they should do. I feel bad even when I know im perfectly justified in saying so
Ishipwillowandhunter: how are you not sad while horny
Ishipwillowandhunter: I get that Izzy. I'm sorry
Lazurus: I just think about all the dicks I can suck and it works for me ig idk
Izzy_blight: Im sorry too
Izzy_blight: Is the choice only for you to be sad or horny? Is  there a third option 
Dtrump: uh oh
Lazurus: yeah no I only have two modes
Dtrump: horny seems like your favorite 
Izzy_blight: yeah im sorry 
Izzy_blight: Oh well, sucks for me. Deal with it loserbel
Lazurus: I wonder if my old user is still on here hold on
Lazurus: yes it is and I hope it dies
Izzy_blight: I hope i die.i hope im high. I hope flowers rain down from the fucking sky
Lazurus: wants to add deck Gay yiff from e621. (Click to view.)
Lazurus: ...
Izzy_blight: Uh. No thank you 
Lazurus: wrong chatroom...
Lazurus: sry
Izzy_blight: Oh,.
Lazurus: why do people try and drown themselves at pools and beaches so the lifeguard will preform CPR on them like yeah you get touched for the first time in your life but you also get seven broken ribs in the processes
Lazurus: I'm pretty sure the reward isn't worth the risk
Izzy_blight: I almost drowned in a hotel swimming pool when i was probably 8
Rogue: idk id let a cutie break my ribs 
Dtrump: me
Lazurus: I don't know why I laughed at that but you get that rouge also iz I've had that experience weirdly just in a public pool
Izzy_blight: Oh im sorry about that 
Rogue: less damage than a broken heart anyway
Lazurus: meh don't be
Lazurus: it might actually break your heart or puncture a valve and you'll bleed out slowly and painfully
Lazurus: I want the BIG SUCC
Rogue: same bruv
Dtrump: gay
Lazurus: nah I got socks on just not pants
Lazurus: jk lol
Dtrump: I'm naked
Izzy_blight: Silence wench. I do not wish to be horny anymore. i just want to be happy
Lazurus: i just spit coffee all on my laptop
Dtrump: I'm a wrench
Rogue: wish that was my mouth
Rogue: I mean haha very random
Lazurus: woah hol up wait a minute summ aint right here
Lazurus: lmao
Rogue: Im innocent 
Lazurus: till proven otherwise
Rogue: exactly ;)
Lazurus: as your lawyer I'd advise you not to say anything that might get taken out of context but then again I'm not your lawyer so go ahead
Inasg_no: are you fucking kidding me
Lazurus: hey tay wb
Lazurus: what up
Izzy_blight: Whas wrong 
Dtrump: no never meant that kidding me person I swear

Izzy_blight: Intrusive thoughts and trauma flashbacks are trying to crush me. But im going to try focus on more decent things instead. At least Im gonna have a big bowl of tasty macaroni soon. At least aj isnt here tonight. At least jimmys dead again
Dtrump: go back to cunt you were born
Lazurus: and I'm quoting myself so no-one can
Lazurus: im not gonna let the intrusive thoughts win tonight
Lazurus: today*
Dtrump: they win 
Lazurus: yeah but later
Izzy_blight: They always do eventually.just have to hold the gates  as long as you can 
Inasg_no: Aw
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm not sure what to say anymore
Inasg_no: I'm proud of you Izzy
Ishipwillowandhunter: You're doing well. I'm sorry that this is difficult. But you'll have macaroni soon and that's very good. Remember to drink water. Or something. No dehydration 
Dtrump: my toe is bad
Lazurus: wise words
Lazurus: just don't fall up stairs
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't feel like I have a place here

Lazurus: well apparently we are so lets just deal with it and move on
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm not sure if I've made progress or not. I've taken a step back and then a step forward and then I've been pushed to the side until i'm practically doing the tango

Izzy_blight: Jimmy, a vile creature lurking in the shadows, preying on the innocent and vulnerable. He slithers like a serpent, his intentions twisted and perverse. Oh, the depths of his depravity are unimaginable, a true monster in human form. The world shudders in disgust at the mere mention of his name, for he embodies the darkest recesses of humanity's nightmares.
Ishipwillowandhunter: awww. that's veyr sweet

Izzy_blight: Sorry about that
Neko_yeetus: I also got my PlayStation taken so that's cool
Dtrump: masturbate first
Izzy_blight: Jesus
Neko_yeetus: More like my stepmom ripped the cable out of it while it was on
Neko_yeetus: Hope it's not broken
Neko_yeetus: All because I forgot to hand wash a few cups while doing the dishes
Dtrump: did she switch you

Izzy_blight: I don't know. We'll see. Yeah sorry I know I'm a bit lacking in enthusiasm right now 
Neko_yeetus: My grandparents are from Ireland so I'm super excited
Dtrump: northern England sucks
Neko_yeetus: I'm really hoping Isaac has a message me on PlayStation or discord and please don't message me on discord
Izzy_blight: I don't have much to say to you right now. Not because I'm mad at you. I'm just hurt
Neko_yeetus: Yeah me too so
Neko_yeetus: Not sure what you want me to say
Izzy_blight: Sorry
Dtrump: ouch 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yeah.... sorry guys
Izzy_blight: I always only think about myself 
Dtrump: no shit sherlock
Izzy_blight: Haha yeah 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Anyways.... thoughts on the Netherlands 
Neko_yeetus: I'd like to go there
Dtrump: I love nether regions.
Neko_yeetus: lmaooo
Ishipwillowandhunter: Me too, the lava situation is kinda annoying though
Ishipwillowandhunter: I just wanna see it for a week or two
Neko_yeetus: Yeah just a little inconvenient that you know houses are being destroyed stuff like that
Izzy_blight: I'm gonna keep my mouth shut. Just this once 
Neko_yeetus: Like that's really lame
Neko_yeetus: Stupid lava
Inasg_no: um trump
Dtrump: um tay
Inasg_no: Why does northern England suck 
Dtrump: I forgot why
Neko_yeetus: Guys did you know we can cure the French people
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh I was meaning real life, lava irl is cool. Sure, some people lose all of their possessions but like it looks cool so who cares
Ishipwillowandhunter: not real life, minecraft*
Ishipwillowandhunter: We can??
Ishipwillowandhunter: Holocaust pt.2?
Neko_yeetus: If you give them sleep apnea surgery
Neko_yeetus: They can no longer make the noises required to speak French
Inasg_no: I'm in northern England 
Dtrump: sleep apnea is not
Dtrump: fun
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh really?
Inasg_no: Hate on the south 
Dtrump: I'm from the ira
Neko_yeetus: Yeah that sound that they make that sounds like they have stage 3 lung cancer
07:21:48
Saturday, 6 April, 2024
Neko_yeetus: The thing that gives them the ability to do that gets removed
Ishipwillowandhunter: I wish they did. Their entire kind. Ugh. Barely even human
Dtrump: I snore loud
Neko_yeetus: The doctor think I have sleep apnea
Neko_yeetus: They want my mom to watch me while I sleep
Neko_yeetus: She said no so I guess she wants me to die
Ishipwillowandhunter: 10/10 mom, amazing. Could you record yourself while you sleep? idk
Dtrump: I had a sleep test done.
Inasg_no: why 
Neko_yeetus: Oh actually that's a good idea but an 8 hour recording
Dtrump: for sleep apnea
Dtrump: I need to lose weight in the next few years or I am doomed.
Neko_yeetus: Sometimes when I am like on the edge of sleep like I'm asleep but I'm not asleep I wake myself up because I'm not breathing
Inasg_no: It said sleep apnea can be linked to obesity 
Dtrump: yeah that's sleep apea
Neko_yeetus: Oh fun
Ishipwillowandhunter: Just buy a 399 dollar video camera, no big deal
Neko_yeetus: lmao
Dtrump: Either you wear a mask that supplies oxygen into your lungs or lose weight.
Ishipwillowandhunter: And yeah, that sucks. And is scary. and dangerous. No no
Neko_yeetus: I gained a lot of weight in the past couple of months because of birth control
Neko_yeetus: Gay
Inasg_no: Does your period hurt
Neko_yeetus: But I've been losing it so we're good
Izzy_blight: ...
Neko_yeetus: Yeah that's why I have the like implant thing
Inasg_no: Oh right 
Neko_yeetus: My mom has PCOS so
Inasg_no: Ik a bunch of people that go on bc just for the period 
Neko_yeetus: Yeah I don't really have it anymore
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yeah, sometimes helps sometimes doesn't. Side effects are a bitch though. Glad I don't have the skill issue of being a woman
Neko_yeetus: Wow
Ishipwillowandhunter: <3
Ishipwillowandhunter: c
Ishipwillowandhunter: and when I hear my name
Neko_yeetus: Michael don't leave me here AAAHHHHH
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm not leaving youuu dww. I'm far too lonely to do that
Neko_yeetus: har har harhar har
Ishipwillowandhunter: oh yeah also you'e nice totalk to but mainly loneliness
Neko_yeetus: Unfortunately I won't be on as much as I usually am
Ishipwillowandhunter: That's okay, is it because of the phone thing or something else?
Neko_yeetus: It's a bit hard to type when on a fucking TV
Neko_yeetus: Yeah the phone thing
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yeah how does tha twork?
Ishipwillowandhunter: I hope you get it back soon :(
Neko_yeetus: I have a web browser on my TV
Ishipwillowandhunter: yeah no I know about that
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm just meaning
Ishipwillowandhunter: are you using speech to text?
Ishipwillowandhunter: how are you typing so fast
Neko_yeetus: Yes
Ishipwillowandhunter: ahh okay that makes sense
Neko_yeetus: No I just type freakishly fast
Ishipwillowandhunter: lmao you're just completely fucking destroying your remote typing at the speed of light
Neko_yeetus: lmaoooo
Ishipwillowandhunter: oh god give me a sec
Neko_yeetus: I am now a little concerned for your well-being
Izzy_blight: Oh well that's a surprise 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Okay it's alright i'm fine
Neko_yeetus: Oh good
07:34:31
Saturday, 6 April, 2024
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm so confused right now
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm extremely sleep deprived so it's possible I'm hallucinating 
Neko_yeetus: Sleep?
Neko_yeetus: Maybe
Izzy_blight: Please 
Izzy_blight: I thought you slept today 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh I did. Unfortunately an hour thirty isn't enough for me now. And no. Sleep is for the weak/women
Izzy_blight: What the fuck
Neko_yeetus: I don't know what time it is
Izzy_blight: You said
Izzy_blight: Hnbgfthhjuytgbv
Neko_yeetus: I don't have a clock
Ishipwillowandhunter: It's 3:36 for you, and yes I did say Izzy but it didn't happen
Ishipwillowandhunter: not my choice
Izzy_blight: Fuck
Izzy_blight: Fucking shit
Izzy_blight: I know. Sorry 
Neko_yeetus: Well I already know we're not gonna be able to convince you to sleep
Neko_yeetus: Cause you're a stubborn bitch
Izzy_blight: Unfortunately, right
Ishipwillowandhunter: You know it <3 my best quality. That's not saying anything at all
Izzy_blight: Sigh
Neko_yeetus: In 9 hours I will be laying on a table for 5-6 hours straight
Neko_yeetus: And that is the end of that conversation cause I forgot
Neko_yeetus: My bad iz
Ishipwillowandhunter: Man what'd I'd give to attach myself to a giant firework and fly into a large skyscraper 
Izzy_blight: Whats your bad? It's probably mine
Neko_yeetus: 9/11?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh the tattoo thing
Izzy_blight: Maybe dont do that 
Ishipwillowandhunter: 9/11, but colorful
Neko_yeetus: ye
Neko_yeetus: I don't know it's pretty colorful
Neko_yeetus: Especially the ground
Izzy_blight: Oh. Well that's the thing least bothering me right now 
Neko_yeetus: Sorry
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh... oh no....
Ishipwillowandhunter: I want a color other than red
Izzy_blight: That's the one thing i get any apology for?
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm thinking black creeper fading to lime green
Izzy_blight: Sorry im forgetting my place 
Neko_yeetus: Yes it is izzy
Izzy_blight: Great, thanks.
Neko_yeetus: We were both assholes to each other I don't think either of us need to apologize unless both of us do
Izzy_blight: We both definitely do
Izzy_blight: I will if you do
Izzy_blight: No forget it. I'm sorry for being a horrible trash bag 
Neko_yeetus: What's the point of apologizing if it's just gonna happen again?
Neko_yeetus: I mean it happens oh well
Izzy_blight: It would make me feel better 
Neko_yeetus: You get your feelings hurt I get my feelings hurt we're both pissed off and annoyed by the end of the night
Ishipwillowandhunter: I think it's worse getting an apology and then the same thing happening again
Izzy_blight: Ah god damn it you're right
Neko_yeetus: An apology means change
Ishipwillowandhunter: a sincere one at least
Izzy_blight: I'll never change
Neko_yeetus: And I already know what's not gonna change and I think I'm okay with that
Neko_yeetus: I mean yeah it sucks that you have to go through all of this in your brain
Neko_yeetus: But I'm an arsehole
Neko_yeetus: Arsenal really
Neko_yeetus: Oh my god
Izzy_blight: I'm going to die exactly the same way I am now and it's going to be my own damn fault. I look forward to it
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm so confused
Ishipwillowandhunter: I mean
Ishipwillowandhunter: half confused?
Dtrump: just do it
Ishipwillowandhunter: confused about my own confusion
Neko_yeetus: At this point izzy I'm not gonna apologize and as much as this makes me sound like an asshole I'm not sorry
07:47:14
Saturday, 6 April, 2024
Neko_yeetus: And I don't think you are either
Neko_yeetus: But I could be wrong
Izzy_blight: That's okay. I don't deserve your apologies. Oh believe me I am 
Neko_yeetus: Also this is not intended to be like mad or anything I'm just kind of neutral right now
Dtrump: common sense here
Izzy_blight: I understand. I am truly sorry for being a horrible headache 
Neko_yeetus: Izzy you may be a little annoying at times but I love your presence so
Neko_yeetus: You are not a horrible headache
Dtrump: too much drama
Neko_yeetus: Trump take your too much drama and shove it up your limp dick
Neko_yeetus: I'm trying to have a conversation
Izzy_blight: I feel much calmer now.I'm sorry for the trouble I cause. I don't want to cause it
Izzy_blight: But
Dtrump: Actually I'm on Izzy's side.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Trump what the fuck are you on about
Izzy_blight: I. Can I just ramble a tiny bit? Then I'll shut up. I love you 
Izzy_blight: There are no sides
Neko_yeetus: Ramble as much as you want love
Dtrump: I will send Godzilla to your country.
Neko_yeetus: Oh he's upset I called him limp dick
Neko_yeetus: Womp womp
Dtrump: Oh I got confused.
Dtrump: I went to law school btw
Izzy_blight: This is to both of you, really. You should be able to say and do whatever you want, regardless of whether it's bad for me, or even yourself. It's your right. Obviously. And I know empathy doesn't always come to you as easily as it does me. You have disorders and problems too, much worse than mine and I hate forcing mine on you constantly
Inasg_no: Trump
Inasg_no: I love you
Izzy_blight: I know the only way I can be fixed is if I reach out and have someone else help me. But I don't want that. I refuse to ask anyone for help with anything. I'm not worth anybody else's time or effort, and I'm too ashamed and confused about myself to really open up.
Izzy_blight: But I refuse to help myself, either. I don't want to be fixed. I want to suffer. But my fixation on my own self-loathing hurts the people I care about too. The only reason I want to get better is to stop hurting you. But as deep as my everlasting love for you goes, it seems like nothing can ever be greater within me than the apocalyptic, earth-shattering hatred I have for myself
Dtrump: I will rape you
Ishipwillowandhunter: Trump I'm going to violently shove bee hives up your tiny little cigar cutter shut the fuck up
Izzy_blight: I deliberately hurt myself any way I can, just for masochistic satisfaction, without enough regard for the consequences. Which is why I'm always here
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm sorry Izzy. I genuinely wish you would at least give therapy a try because it can do you a lot of good and you do deserve help from someone. You deserve it irl most of all but I understand that can't really happen
Dtrump: I cant control my fingers right now.
Neko_yeetus: I totally understand where you're coming from izzy
Izzy_blight: Yeah. I. I don't know. Maybe I'll stop being a moron eventually. Hopefully. Oh... I'm sorry to hear that 
Neko_yeetus: No 1 can force you to get help no 1 can convince you to get help by yourself and time changes so much
Dtrump: I was a machine on SSRIs before.
Neko_yeetus: I hate stupid Texas beach
Neko_yeetus: Oh my god
Izzy_blight: I know how you feel 
Neko_yeetus: I am trying to be sincere
Dtrump: I'm going to strap you
07:59:56
Saturday, 6 April, 2024
Neko_yeetus: Hopefully 1 day izzy you will see that you are a burden to no one
Dtrump: I'm a burden to no one but my master.
Neko_yeetus: Why will it not spell out the #1
Izzy_blight: It's okay i know the speech to text struggle. Hopefully I do. Not for my sake but for everyone elses
Neko_yeetus: What the hell
Dtrump: God is my master.
Neko_yeetus: The only person I worship is my favorite music artist
Dtrump: varg vikkernes
Ishipwillowandhunter: I worship anyone with a love for 13th century japan
Dtrump: Didn't they go extinct.
Neko_yeetus: I wanna read love letters from very long time ago
Neko_yeetus: I feel like that would be so interesting
Dtrump: Read my grandpas love letter to my grandma bonafide smut book.
Neko_yeetus: Mail it to me on my address
Ishipwillowandhunter: I have a hobby of writing cringey love poems that give off victorian era vibes 
Neko_yeetus: I'll give you my address*
Ishipwillowandhunter: mmm daddy daddy if you want it drop the addy give me love give me fendy my balenciaga daddy
Dtrump: Do it and I will send mysterious hard drives with shocking things.
Izzy_blight: Most people here are traumatized but are considered fun because of it. I'm just  traumatized and as miserable as a snake with a toothache. Why couldn't i have gotten an entertaining disorder like schizophrenia or exhibitionism
Ishipwillowandhunter: I bOuGhT hArD dRiVeS fRoM tHe DaRk WeB
Neko_yeetus: Exhibitionism
Ishipwillowandhunter: exhibitionism is a disorder?
Neko_yeetus: No I'm confused
Izzy_blight: Yes
Dtrump: there might be a kid and some old guy
Neko_yeetus: I don't think that's a disorder
Izzy_blight: It is
Neko_yeetus: Hold on I'll be right back
Ishipwillowandhunter: "extravagant behavior that is intended to attract attention to oneself."
Dtrump: aka nudists
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't think that's really a disorder
Ishipwillowandhunter: there's also like the sexual exhibition thing
Dtrump: my grandpa was a nudist
Ishipwillowandhunter: see trump gets it
Dtrump: I know every porn category.
Neko_yeetus: Apparently there are 2 definitions
Neko_yeetus: I don't think she wants to know the second 1
Izzy_blight: No point protecting me right now 
Neko_yeetus: You sure
Izzy_blight: No
Dtrump: two people fucking in front of a crowd
Neko_yeetus: OK then I won't tell you
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't think either definitions are a disorder though
Izzy_blight: But i crave pain
Ishipwillowandhunter: you will get none
Ishipwillowandhunter: or very little
Neko_yeetus: It just means a desire to have sex in public
Izzy_blight: I will not be denied my happiness
Izzy_blight: thank you 
Neko_yeetus: That's why I was confused
Dtrump: sex in public where kids see it
Neko_yeetus: Can you not jump
Neko_yeetus: No do jump
Dtrump: ok I'm on my roof
Neko_yeetus: That's it I'm gonna jump
Inasg_no: Trump 
Neko_yeetus: I hate text to speech
Dtrump: right onto the pavement head first
Neko_yeetus: wooohoo
Neko_yeetus: Actually don't do that
Neko_yeetus: I do not promote suicide
Ishipwillowandhunter: seems like a horrible way to attempt, what if you end up paralyzed 
Ishipwillowandhunter: oh right yeah don't do it cuz suicide bad
Ishipwillowandhunter: seriously please don't
Dtrump: then I will just wait for a truck to crush my skull
Neko_yeetus: I'm just glad I wasn't born in like the 50s and before or 20 years after
Ishipwillowandhunter: why not?
Neko_yeetus: Cause if I was the same person I would have been lobotomized
Ishipwillowandhunter: or why?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh, right
Ishipwillowandhunter: Eh well a lobotomy never hurt anyone
Dtrump: I would have been killing Jews.
Ishipwillowandhunter: look at Kennedy's wife
Neko_yeetus: I read and I practice witchy stuff
Dtrump: Kennedy's sister*
Inasg_no: Ok goodbye
Izzy_blight: May I be excused? I don't want you guys to have to deal with me anymore right now. I want to go be a miserable buzzkill somewhere else
Dtrump: she became retarded
Ishipwillowandhunter: You can go if you want but you're really not a bother
Neko_yeetus: If you'd like to go you can but you can stay
Neko_yeetus: You're not bothering me
08:12:38
Saturday, 6 April, 2024

Dtrump: I will send a message to your parents.
Neko_yeetus: Azaleas are fine
Ishipwillowandhunter: they're very pretty
Neko_yeetus: I have several cods
Ishipwillowandhunter: flowers make great metaphors
Neko_yeetus: I had an azalea
Ishipwillowandhunter: what happened to it?
Dtrump: I know some lawyers in north Carolina.
Neko_yeetus: It died
Neko_yeetus: After me and my ex broke up it died
Neko_yeetus: It's weird cause he's the 1 that gave it to me
Ishipwillowandhunter: Witch. Burn him.
Neko_yeetus: If text to speech could type out the word 1
Ishipwillowandhunter: I have the pitchforks and lighter flid
Ishipwillowandhunter: flid
Dtrump: I love your EX
Neko_yeetus: XD
Ishipwillowandhunter: that hollow feeling in your chest
Ishipwillowandhunter: as you both wordlessly undress
Ishipwillowandhunter: after a fight it's getting late
Izzy_blight: I don't think things are going to get any better for me here tonight. I'm jealous, angry, hurt and a lot of other things I have no right or reason to be so I'm going to go immediately before I say anything else I regret. Because I'm extremely tempted. Love you both sorry good night
Ishipwillowandhunter: you tried your best but then she cried and you're to blame
Raul_menendez: anxiety?
Ishipwillowandhunter: I love you Izzy <33 I'm sorry for all the bad feelings. I'll tlk to you soon hopefully
Dtrump: smack her around
Raul_menendez: isn't that just anxiety?
Neko_yeetus: :/okay
Raul_menendez: :|
Raul_menendez: what cods u got?
Neko_yeetus: Love you izzy
Neko_yeetus: Cold war
Raul_menendez: <3 izzy
Neko_yeetus: BO4
Neko_yeetus: uhhh
Dtrump: grab her by the pussy
Neko_yeetus: I got my PlayStation taken so I can't check
Raul_menendez: I have cold war downloaded...
Neko_yeetus: I knew it was the real trump
Neko_yeetus: I don't it takes up way too much space
Neko_yeetus: I think I have 1 of the modern warfares
Ishipwillowandhunter: CoD zombies was my main gamemode 
Dtrump: I have the old one.
Ishipwillowandhunter: I judge all CoD games based off the zombies mode
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't care if you have a triple a campaign, if your zombies is shit i'm deleting and leaving a scathing review 
Neko_yeetus: No I have advanced warfare
Neko_yeetus: It took me 3 years to finish it because I couldn't get past something
Dtrump: I have call of duty blow up palestie
Neko_yeetus: Now on my Xbox 360
Dtrump: mine has dust
Ishipwillowandhunter: I played like 2 hours of advance warfare and then nothing else
Ishipwillowandhunter: was it good?
Neko_yeetus: I have call of duty ghost modern warfare modern warfare 2
08:25:21
Saturday, 6 April, 2024
Neko_yeetus: Black ops and black ops 2
Neko_yeetus: Honestly I don't remember if advanced warfare is good I think it was kind of mid but I can't remember
Ishipwillowandhunter: All goated except cod ghosts, I never liked ghosts 
Neko_yeetus: I liked ghost
Ishipwillowandhunter: yeah that's what I was thinking, probably why I stopped playing
Dtrump: Call of duty kill the Mexicans?
Ishipwillowandhunter: the campaign was decent
Neko_yeetus: Oh man this call of duty modern warfare was bought used for $45
Ishipwillowandhunter: I didn't like the zombies mode thought and like I said earlier, I jduge every cod game off of their zombie mode if they have one
Ishipwillowandhunter: fr?? New or old warfare? what the fuck
Neko_yeetus: Well it's Xbox 360 so old
Dtrump: try temu
Raul_menendez: I love you for that mich lmao bo4 was kinda shit with its zobies
Raul_menendez: zombies*
Neko_yeetus: Damn 2007
Neko_yeetus: Oh yeah BO4 is shit I hate it
Ishipwillowandhunter: bo4 is garbage
Raul_menendez: no campaign seriously
Ishipwillowandhunter: it's trash
Neko_yeetus: Though it's the 1st zombies I played because I was too much of a pussy to play it
Raul_menendez: bo3 campaign was goated asf
Ishipwillowandhunter: *insert know your place trash meme*
Dtrump: hate speech is free speech
Neko_yeetus: I used to get very angry when I died
Ishipwillowandhunter: bo3 campaign was.... decent. Not too god
Ishipwillowandhunter: I loveeddddd the zombies mode though
Neko_yeetus: Like very badly and I only played in creative mode because I was scared to die in Minecraft
Raul_menendez: I had the chronicle endition and I fucking loved it
Neko_yeetus: I have changed
Ishipwillowandhunter: You've evolved, very good
Ishipwillowandhunter: I used t obe like that
Raul_menendez: not me lmao
Dtrump: call of the wild whores
Ishipwillowandhunter: to be fair I was 8, now I see the beauty in having one life and I also see red when I fall into a ravine and lose two weeks of progress
Raul_menendez: I was getting fucking jumped scare by the 3 headed mastard in bo3 shadows of evil lmao
Neko_yeetus: I have a really cool story to tell everyone shut up
Ishipwillowandhunter: yes ma'am
Neko_yeetus: My father used to play zombies until like 4:00 AM
Raul_menendez: he's a true cod zombie player
Ishipwillowandhunter: bro me fr
Raul_menendez: lmao
Ishipwillowandhunter: Origins 
Neko_yeetus: 1 night I think he threw a flash bang while he was playing or something like that
Ishipwillowandhunter: Origins had me pulling all nighters
Raul_menendez: its ee is so damn long!
Ishipwillowandhunter: wait flashbangs in cod zombies?
Neko_yeetus: But as it exploded lightning hit the power lines outside and they both blew up at the same time and the power went out and it was crazy
Raul_menendez: tf?
Neko_yeetus: I said I can't remember
Raul_menendez: lmao
Neko_yeetus: Yes I know there are no flashbangs in zombies
Raul_menendez: probs widows wine
Neko_yeetus: It was like 10 years ago
Ishipwillowandhunter: oh my dumbass, forgot there were stun grenades. And wow that must've been scary. I would've thought myself a god if I was your dad ngl
Ishipwillowandhunter: stuns are a thing and they're kinda like flashes in bo2 zombies but not really
Raul_menendez: there were also emps in bo2
Neko_yeetus: Shut up I don't remember you guys
Raul_menendez: loved what the bus driver would do to lmao
Neko_yeetus: That was supposed to say fuck you guys
Ishipwillowandhunter: Wow, you don't remember me? :'(
Ishipwillowandhunter: I thought a meant at least some neuron space but I guess not
Neko_yeetus: lmaooo
Raul_menendez: remember throwing a emp at the bus driver made him shut down and stop working for the rest of the game? lol
Ishipwillowandhunter: I remember shooting him until his eyes turned red and getting thrown of
Ishipwillowandhunter: *off
Neko_yeetus: How many zombies had a bus driver in it
Raul_menendez: or when you keep on hitting him to the point he kicks you off lmao
Raul_menendez: lol
Ishipwillowandhunter: Man if only irl bus drivers were like that. You shoot them one time and they're dead
Ishipwillowandhunter: only bo2, tranzit. Tranzit sucked but the bus driver was great
Raul_menendez: ikr fr
Raul_menendez: lol ye
Neko_yeetus: The 1 that scared me the most is when you went into like the fog or some shit and you got attacked by whatever the fuck that thing was
Neko_yeetus: I don't know what I'm talking about
Raul_menendez: YES!
Ishipwillowandhunter: Ew, yeah I know what you're talkigna bout
Ishipwillowandhunter: I hate those fucking things
Raul_menendez: those baby motherfuckers
Ishipwillowandhunter: I think they're called denizens or something
Raul_menendez: makes you wanna punt a child like a football
Ishipwillowandhunter: I want to do that normally anyways
Raul_menendez: BRO
Neko_yeetus: Can someone let me know what time it is please
Ishipwillowandhunter: Its 4:35 for you hon
Raul_menendez: the monkey round was so fucking annoying on asencion
Dtrump: I'm a monkey
Neko_yeetus: I remember when my dad would get me mad because he got the monkey instead of a good gun
Izzy_blight: Okay separation anxiety is obsessive compulsive and I can't separate myself from you or I feel horrific anxiety that I'm going to have lost you by the time I come back or that something bad will happen without my knowledge or that by not being here I'll be failing to provide some sort of valuable service to you despite doing nothing here but watching and suffering mostly in silence and. yeah
Neko_yeetus: He's a silly little boy that monkey
Ishipwillowandhunter: Welcome back love, we're talking about cod zombies
Raul_menendez: lmao
Ishipwillowandhunter: I think all of bo1 zombies is great
Neko_yeetus: Just casual talk about zombie games woo-hoo
Ishipwillowandhunter: all of bo2's dlc maps are great
Raul_menendez: kino DER toten the goat
Ishipwillowandhunter: and 90% of bo3 is good
Neko_yeetus: I like the campaigns
Raul_menendez: the gaints map was ass
Ishipwillowandhunter: ww2 zombies is my favorite though
Raul_menendez: eeh
08:38:04
Saturday, 6 April, 2024
Ishipwillowandhunter: Bro, the Bo2 campaign is the greatest CoD campaign ever imo
Neko_yeetus: I feel your pain right now izzy don't worry I feel very left out
Ishipwillowandhunter: I have so many memories
Ishipwillowandhunter: Aww 
Izzy_blight: Oh I'm sorry 
Neko_yeetus: Not because of them but because what they're talking about
Ishipwillowandhunter: Did you have any of the DLC's for bo2, AJ?
Neko_yeetus: Please continue I did not mean to interrupt your conversation
Izzy_blight: Oh so when aj feels left out it's important but when I 
Ishipwillowandhunter: it didn't really have a track it's all over the place
Neko_yeetus: No
Izzy_blight: Mmm. This is why I didn't 
Neko_yeetus: Awesome
Izzy_blight: h. Fuck
Ishipwillowandhunter: I told you what we were talking about and was sorta just continuing because right now is one of those moments where I'm talkign way too much about any given thing for no reason at all 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I need to get up and walk or something really quick brb sorry
Izzy_blight: It's not that 
Neko_yeetus: I'm gonna go take a melatonin
Raul_menendez: mw2 campaign best
Raul_menendez: and I mean the OG!
Izzy_blight: Sorry love you 
Neko_yeetus: Hey my mom's awake so I gotta go guys I love you
Raul_menendez: love you to Izzy fizzy
Neko_yeetus: Everyone go the fuck to sleep
Raul_menendez: bye bye
Izzy_blight: Sorry love you 
Izzy_blight: We won't do that, especially not Michael cause we're all stubborn as mules
Dtrump: nda
Raul_menendez: good idea I'm going to work tomorrow to help my parents
Izzy_blight: Good luck with that 
Ishipwillowandhunter: why is everything pain suddenly
Izzy_blight: It has been 
Izzy_blight: Sorry baby
Raul_menendez: isn't everything always have pain in it but most times the pain is so small you don't feel it as pain
Ishipwillowandhunter: no I was
Ishipwillowandhunter: confused
Ishipwillowandhunter: and energetic
Ishipwillowandhunter: and a little shaken behind the eyes
Ishipwillowandhunter: but it didn't hurt
Izzy_blight: Uh
Izzy_blight: That is concerning but I am sorry 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I've gotten more sleep recently than usual so I don't know why I'm so damn tired tonight
Raul_menendez: you sound cannadian
Raul_menendez: because you actually been getting on some sort of schedule so your body has gotten use to that and is now wondering wtf are you still up
Ishipwillowandhunter: lmao yeah even my body thinks I'm an idiot
Izzy_blight: Oh that's just lovely
Izzy_blight: Extra torture for your poor abused body
Dtrump: I wi

Ishipwillowandhunter: music is a cure all
Dtrump: hadache
Ishipwillowandhunter: roll the city
Ishipwillowandhunter: bad little bitty
Ishipwillowandhunter: i don't remember what it is
Ishipwillowandhunter: but
Ishipwillowandhunter: I had a friend
Ishipwillowandhunter: or something close
Ishipwillowandhunter: that'd drag her nails on my arm
Izzy_blight: I don't have the heart to kill that horrible man but I often feel like I do. I often wish I did. Anything to end this
Ishipwillowandhunter: scratch my arms
Ishipwillowandhunter: you know what I mean
Ishipwillowandhunter: I love that feeling
Izzy_blight: Oh
Izzy_blight: I don't like that at all 
Dtrump: horbbile jofh
Ishipwillowandhunter: it was just friendly of course
Ishipwillowandhunter: but
Ishipwillowandhunter: I mss it
Izzy_blight: I don't like it
Ishipwillowandhunter: why not?
Dtrump: jui d
Ishipwillowandhunter: i think is very innocent
Izzy_blight: I. Mnhnbgnnhjm. Nothing, no reason.
Dtrump: big mama jama
Ishipwillowandhunter: :(
Raul_menendez: vladmir_putin
Izzy_blight: I just. I don't like the thought of
Raul_menendez: vladmir_makarov
Ishipwillowandhunter: of...
Raul_menendez: hurts people
Izzy_blight: of anyone
Izzy_blight: I'm trying give me a minute 
Raul_menendez: dma
Raul_menendez: damn
Izzy_blight: He does do that 
Dtrump: Chinese rats 
Raul_menendez: I'm your little stupid part of your conscience that has no purpose
Raul_menendez: just to be stupid
Ishipwillowandhunter: Ha. You think any part of my conscience has a purpose
Ishipwillowandhunter: And sorry Izzy.
Izzy_blight: I don't like the thought of anyone doing anything to hurt you in any way even if you like it. When you say "scratch" I know what you probably mean but i imagine it much worse 
Dtrump: Mr snigger
Raul_menendez: gn y'all have a good night mich, isa, and trump
Izzy_blight: Good nigh
Izzy_blight: t
Raul_menendez: I hope you find some sort of comfort izzy
Izzy_blight: Well I have junk food and porn. That's all I got
Ishipwillowandhunter: Goodnight. I have music
Ishipwillowandhunter: And it wasn't hurting
Ishipwillowandhunter: It was
Ishipwillowandhunter: Imagine gently dragging your fingers down someone's arm. Across their skin. Now imagine you have acryllic nails and doing the same thing. Now imagine you don't have those and instead you're just doing it with the tips of your fingers, absentmindedly 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Like running your hand through someones hair
Ishipwillowandhunter: it's not pulling
Izzy_blight: Okay. Yes. I feel much better, thank you. I have very intense feelings that no one should ever have. Sorry
Ishipwillowandhunter: I know honey. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset even if it was unintentional 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm just really missing some form of physical contact. 
09:03:29
Saturday, 6 April, 2024
Izzy_blight: I know. I'm sorry. I
Izzy_blight: I want you to have everything you want and be a hapy
Ishipwillowandhunter: I want you to be happy oo. Lots of happy
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't crave sex anymore. haven't for a while. Don't want or need it.I want intimacy in non sexual ways. Cuddling, back scratching, massages, reading together, etc.
Izzy_blight: I'm afraid there's not much that makes me happy. That makes me happy and also sad I'm sorry 
Izzy_blight: I would do most anything to give you those things right now 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I would do absolutely anything or us to have led normal lives up tull this point
Izzy_blight: That might be the thing you've ever said that I can agree the most with
Izzy_blight: I don't even care if it would be both of us. If it was only you I'd be extremely happy with that 
09:16:11
Saturday, 6 April, 2024
Izzy_blight: I've hurt a lot of people because of my own issues though. So I guess a reset for me would be good too
Dtrump: I'm naked 
Izzy_blight: In the park again?
Dtrump: I got caught
Izzy_blight: Thats unfortunate but you can afford the best legal team im sure they can get you out easy
Izzy_blight: I suddenly have a massive headache and i feel barrly conscious 
Dtrump: yeah  ok

Rogue: izzy
Izzy_blight: Yes sir 
Rogue: how are you fren
Rogue: is the night long
Izzy_blight: So indescribably awful I can't even begin to tell you. How you 
Rogue: aw you could if it would make you feel better
Rogue: you been here a long time even after everyone else went to sleep
Rogue: im fine dw about me
11:48:41
Saturday, 6 April, 2024
Izzy_blight: I'm waiting for Michael to wake up so i can try to comfort him for accidentally falling asleep. I have little interest in sleeping myself even though I'm quite exhausted. Too full of horror. Well that's good. I worry always though. About everyone 
Izzy_blight: I'm sick of  caring so god damn much about everyone. It's killing me. I am sick and tired of being sick and tired
Rogue: Some german philosopher will tell us over caring breads mental illnes but I know its not something we can turn off
Rogue: Im sorry I know it sucks when youre well being is so affected by other's moods. Makes it hard to find the mental space to just be yourself
Dtrump: netch
Izzy_blight: Everybody else here is a fucking  empathetically challenged sociopath and I wish I was like them. Unfortunately for me my trauma made me develop the opposite way. I am hyperempathetic and place myself below everyone and everything
Izzy_blight: I don't know what myself is but i feel like I'm losing it more and more every day 
Izzy_blight: I'm losing myself, my health, all my friends and relationships, and my life to this stupid disorder that i refuse to have treated because I don't think I'm worth saving. I'm a goddamned fool killing myself and lashing out at everyone else like it's their fault
12:01:23
Saturday, 6 April, 2024
Rogue: I actually relate to that. In most groups I always felt like just the extra or the place holder. And it always felt like my own fault cause of how introverted I am. I always felt like I had to play these rolls just to validate myself. But that was all hopeless I got nothing from pleasing people other than fake friends that was fine with using you
Rogue: Not saying thats your friends, but I feel you also put others worries above yours and it is destroying you to some point
Rogue: youre smart enough to know exactly what you need but you have such little faith in yourself
Izzy_blight: I feel like I'm living other peoples' nightmares and my own at the same time. I can't handle it anymore. I stopped being able to handle it aged ago. Now it's pushing me to the edge of insanity. I feel insane 
Izzy_blight: I try to seem smart sometimes but I'm just as stupid as everyone else here if not at least twice as much 
Rogue: then why hold on to them, if theres any chance of still wanting to care about them you'll have to take care of yourself first
Rogue: we dont have endless amounts of affection to give others. It takes a lot of us
Rogue: youre very aware at least, if you make the wisest choices idk
Izzy_blight: I'm allergic to putting myself first. Even if it's for everyones benefit i can't do it
12:14:06
Saturday, 6 April, 2024
Izzy_blight: The only time I'm concerned about myself is when I'm manic and obnoxiously self righteous
Izzy_blight: It doesn't help me it just makes me act like a jerk
Rogue: Its emotional regulation, and comes out in mania because you naturally neglect those emotions that wants to take care of yourself. So its forced out bluntly
Izzy_blight: That..... makes a lot of sense. That's kind of sad
Rogue: no the sad part is whomever made you believe neglecting yourself for them is normal
Izzy_blight: I almost feel bad for me. Eh, no never mind not really. I feel bad that I can't completely erase those feelings and become entirely devoid of any ego. That would be great. Oh, I think I can thank my dad for that 
Balls19: mindset is whats holding you back
Izzy_blight: I'm aware of that 
Balls19: im sorry to bud in but its mindset
Izzy_blight: Yes it's quite alright. I know I have a toxic mindset but I don't know how to fix it nor do I want to 
Balls19: try changing your mindset and build the courage to put yourself first and then you could do some amazing things
12:26:48
Saturday, 6 April, 2024
Izzy_blight: I'm afraid I can't do that. It's a nice thought though. Sorta
Rogue: its a bit more complicated than that when youre someone with bad experiences and trust issues
Izzy_blight: Yeah
Izzy_blight: People tell me exactly what I should do, and often they're right but it's not as simple as they seem to think it is 
Izzy_blight: I'm a fucked up piece of shit and nothing is as easy as it should be with me 
Rogue: Im going to spray you with a water bottle every time you talk less of yourself
Izzy_blight: It'll only take about 15 minutes before I look like I just came out of a hurricane 
Rogue: hehe
12:39:33
Saturday, 6 April, 2024
Izzy_blight: I would have said only a short time ago that my undying, blazing, white-hot self-hatred is good because it keeps me in my place and in check. I'm starting to realize I think it kinda does the opposite of that 
Rogue: I think it keeps you in place of not wanting anything better for yourself, a comfy hell you prefer over doing the hard work
Rogue: It could also just keep youre grandiose narcissism in check, like a self cripple
Izzy_blight: I suppose it does do that. I'm stuck in a hole that i refuse to climb out of. I'm just here because "I deserve it" and "I can't change, I'm not good enough". That's a horrible thought, I hope I'm not secretly a narcissist 
Rogue: Im not a professional so I hate labeling with these terms
Izzy_blight: Symptoms of narcissism and borderline do overlap quite a bit. I took an NPD test just for fun and it said I was very likely to have it
Rogue: but if I had to guess you would have a narcissist attitude in youre subconscious which is heavily supressed. It does come out tho as all suppresed emptions do but its not in your control or what you want to do. Its there fighting your urge to put everyone in front of you
Rogue: idk if these things makes sense to normal people, I have some weird views of the psyche
Izzy_blight: Interesting theory. I used to speculate on that. I felt like I had a superiority and inferiority complex simultaneously. My views on myself changed rapidly. Although that is a symptom of BPD so it's probably just that 
12:52:15
Saturday, 6 April, 2024
Izzy_blight: There were a lot of things about myself that I never understood until I read about BPD. I feel like I still don't understand but also I do 
Rogue: I feel the same with my schizotypal diagnoses
Rogue: until I found a group of people like me that expressed the condition using art, I knew I found my people lmao
Rogue: I just know bpd people will always question themselves to the point where evey thought seems uselss, and thats litteral hell
Izzy_blight: That sounds like me
Rogue: mental structure corrosion
Rogue:  a sign of lack of ego, not a sign of narcisism
Izzy_blight: I'm glad you found your group. I'm not sure I have a group. Oh yeah that's me alright 
Rogue: thank you, the internet is amazing. Im sure you could find some people to talk about it
Izzy_blight: My daddy did bad things to me. Made me feel things about myself that no child ever should. But unfortunately everyone here has abusive dads, much worse than mine so I'm not special. Yeah, ive thought about it. Maybe I could if I wasn't so terrified of human contact 
Rogue: *sprays bottle*
Rogue: forget about the others, it doesnt invalidate your experience 
Izzy_blight: Ahhh no the holy water im allergic!!!! *demonic hissing*
Izzy_blight: I can't forget. I have a good memory 
Izzy_blight: Funnily enough it works best on the things that hurt the most 
Rogue: okay fine but you cant care of them as a place holder for your own baggage 
13:04:58
Saturday, 6 April, 2024
Izzy_blight: You're right, i cant. But I'm certainly going to try. And fail
Rogue: womp
Izzy_blight: I can't fight my own nature. Cant fight jimmy. He's a god
Rogue: cause youre a terrible negotiator 
Rogue: you got to gamble with your life like youre making a deal with the devil
Ishipwillowandhunter: f/fl
Izzy_blight: Too right
Rogue: if I say to myself nothing makes me happy, based on previous experiences, absolutely nothing will satisfy me ever
Izzy_blight: I don't want to be satisfied. I want to be dead
Izzy_blight: Hello son im sorry that you're awake 
Rogue: he came, he went
Izzy_blight: He go
Izzy_blight: Just like my mom
13:17:40
Saturday, 6 April, 2024
Rogue: u.u
Izzy_blight: I feel.cold. I hope its the icy embrace of mr. Jimmy Freeze
Izzy_blight: hes a big ool popsicle 
Rogue: did he play as penguin in the batman movies
Izzy_blight: No but he was in the penguins of Madagascar 
Izzy_blight: Missed opportunity honestly 
Izzy_blight: Hes a perfect penguin actor hes short and fat and wears a nice suit
Rogue: oh I like a snazzy man
Rogue: I gots to go Izzy
Rogue: ill see you again
Izzy_blight: Of course, have a nice day. Im really grateful for the talk 
Izzy_blight: ❤
Rogue: always

Neko_yeetus: I used to be on my phone
Neko_yeetus: But I can't take it upstairs anymore
Ishipwillowandhunter: Ayyy I have one of those. I've done something similar with a different website so I get its hard. And hell yea, no  babies for you. 
Lazurus: I'm fine with the phone but hows it feel to type with your remote🤣
Dtrump: Oh by the way you guys wont be able to be on here tomorrow.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Typing on a remote is frustrating as hell 
Neko_yeetus: I use text to speech
Lazurus: damn you got a life on us trump
Ishipwillowandhunter: She's using text to speed h tho 
Ishipwillowandhunter: *speech 
Neko_yeetus: Which is why when I say Mitch there's a T.

Lazurus: text to speed the best drug delivery service
Ishipwillowandhunter: Aww, Trump 
Neko_yeetus: That's okay oh Mitch I got my phone back so we can use discord again
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't know why but I find you so cute
Ishipwillowandhunter: Servers won't go down, maybe if there was a solar flare 
Lazurus: ~Aah!
Dtrump: The government might do some wacky shit still.
Lazurus: f that was supposed to be whispered
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh? Okay good. Kinda sucks you can't use it now tho 
Lazurus: also sounds about right tbh
Neko_yeetus: Yeah I assume so are you ERP right now
Ishipwillowandhunter: Nigga who the fuck are you whispering that to
Lazurus: don't ask
Ishipwillowandhunter: And why isn't the answer me
Neko_yeetus: Someone just stuck it up his ass
Lazurus: I'm not telling :P
Dtrump: shhhh
Ishipwillowandhunter: Jkjk. Oh yeah you already known
Neko_yeetus: OMGIT's trump
Lazurus: no I'm good
Lazurus: I'm good on that
Neko_yeetus: I had a friend on here that used to accidentally message me his ERPS and I would literally cry
Neko_yeetus: A lot of them were so bad
Dtrump: erping is cringe
Neko_yeetus: I used to do it a lot
Dtrump: I was a erp whore.
Neko_yeetus: Now I just do it in real life
Ishipwillowandhunter: Ngl... I used to do that a lot
Lazurus: im honestly pretty tame when it comes to erps
Ishipwillowandhunter: I haven't erped in months, cuz cringe and vid calls are more fun, but like a year and a half ago I would accidentally pm my friends all the time with erp messages
Lazurus: i dont do it often id rather just send my address and get fucked
Neko_yeetus: There's a subreddit where girls post themselves they're like would you rate me and then you DM them and they give you their address
Neko_yeetus: Rape
Lazurus: is fun when you expect it
Ishipwillowandhunter: Uhh subreddit name?
Lazurus: ayoo
Neko_yeetus: I can't remember I think I almost posted on it 1 time
Lazurus: nah I've been on there its not legit
Ishipwillowandhunter: Kidding, kidding. Kinda.
Dtrump: snuff
Neko_yeetus: Sometimes I disturb myself with my kinks
Ishipwillowandhunter: Me too hon the, me too
Dtrump: I would rather just ip grab random girls.
Lazurus: underage girls 🤨
Dtrump: I just go off what age I remember when I met them.
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm on an edging streak so I've not dine anything in a while but I've came to some rather messed up things. Not illegal or unethical. Or nasty. Just messed up
Neko_yeetus: Edging is so hard for me
Lazurus: the worst thing I've came to was a compilation of people putting things into their urethras
Dtrump: sounding
Lazurus: I had zero material
Neko_yeetus: I accidentally stumbled across a hentai I I don't even wanna describe ITIT was disgusting
Ishipwillowandhunter: Not really into sounding cuz I'm afraid of damage but its alright. And its easy for me to edge myself
Neko_yeetus: Oh goodness the stutter
Lazurus: what guro tentacles?
Dtrump: probably involves a 4 year old
Neko_yeetus: More like shoving safety pins through your nipples
Ishipwillowandhunter: I came across a hentai that was a mix between a snuff film, squid game, and tentacle porn. I ended up it beating it for a week becausen
Ishipwillowandhunter: Ended up not*
Neko_yeetus: And it also involves enemas
Ishipwillowandhunter: ...
Lazurus: send it to meh I want da trauma
Neko_yeetus: It was gross and I stopped watching it
Neko_yeetus: It's long gone now
Lazurus: lol it cant hurt anyone anymore
04:52:41
Monday, 8 April, 2024
Neko_yeetus: I literally sometimes have to go to a different site for porn because like rape roleplay isn't allowed on pornhub
Dtrump: I am curious what I can find on the dark web now.
Neko_yeetus: Then again I have to make sure it's not real rape
Ishipwillowandhunter: Ever found a hentai and watched it for the story instead of the massive jugs?
Lazurus: yes
Neko_yeetus: Yes I have actually
Lazurus: I only watch hentia for the story now
Dtrump: I think I have seen actual rape videos.
Lazurus: same tbh most of them are bloody
Ishipwillowandhunter: Some actually aren't that bad. And you too AJ? I know a few good sites. CNC is fun 
Neko_yeetus: CNC is very fun
Lazurus: I found a site that hosts cartel rape tapes and jesus Christ its bad
Neko_yeetus: No thank you
Neko_yeetus: I'm gonna bust a nut inside your ass
Lazurus: severed heads new holes cut and fucked one girl had her uterus removed while she was conscious and them the guy fucked it shit was terrible
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh bet?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh I know one of those Laz 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Some websites really have no restrictions 
Neko_yeetus: Please don't describe it
Ishipwillowandhunter: The ones that have both snuff films and porn usually blend them together
Dtrump: bestgore was fun
Neko_yeetus: I don't have many limitations but gore is 1 of them
Lazurus: I even found one that had a girl tied up and was getting raped by animals
Neko_yeetus: I'm very sensitive to that if you continue I will puke
Ishipwillowandhunter: Okay Laz no more
Lazurus: ok fine I'll stop trauma dumping
Ishipwillowandhunter: Beastiality, genuine rape, and gore are some things I do not fuck with
Neko_yeetus: Thanks
Lazurus: thinking about that shit makes me sick
Neko_yeetus: Yup same
Ishipwillowandhunter: And you decided to share it with us??
Lazurus: I mean genuine beastiality is a no for me but the dildos and strap ONS of the animals are ok in my book
Lazurus: ons*
Neko_yeetus: The dildo horse cock
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't like anything animal related
Neko_yeetus: Sounds good to me
Lazurus: meh why not you guys where on the topic
Neko_yeetus: Not really I think it's gross
Neko_yeetus: Tentacle porn?
Ishipwillowandhunter: I have very little restrictions but I'm not into anything animal, anything the body produces other than cum and spit and a lil blood, no bugs, death, real rape, etc. 
Lazurus: I mean not horse but canine is fine tbh as long as its not to scale
Ishipwillowandhunter: Tentacle porn not my thing but I can see the appeal 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Brb
Lazurus: its ok ig

Neko_yeetus: I only have a vibrator
Neko_yeetus: I am poor
Lazurus: oof yeah that wouldn't be enough for me that's a starter tbh
Lazurus: I'm poor too hun
Dtrump: I have a hand 
Lazurus: although I live on a res so ig its common
Ishipwillowandhunter: Y'all lucky, I have no sex toys
Neko_yeetus: I bought it for NZ$0.33 off of aliexpress
Ishipwillowandhunter: And my sex drive is weird
Neko_yeetus: Please ignore the NZ
Lazurus: lmao
Neko_yeetus: It was originally $5
Ishipwillowandhunter: if I'm not in any sort of relationship with anyone, I'm not horny at all. If I share a connection with someone then it's all the fucking time
Lazurus: mine are mostly gag gifts from gay friends and my homophobic dad
Ishipwillowandhunter: damn 0.33? even my broke ass could afford that
Lazurus: why when I try to do a bump my nose bleeds all over my powder 🥲
Neko_yeetus: I'm gonna end up buying dildos off of shein

Neko_yeetus: Why not
Lazurus: because they don't sanitize anything
Lazurus: just no
Neko_yeetus: Yeah so I will
Dtrump: A used sextoy shop?

Dtrump: You cant clean herpes of a dildo.
Lazurus: there's some things ya cant clean off
Lazurus: trust me
Lazurus: go on Adam and eve or bad dragon or sum
Neko_yeetus: The 8 year-old that made it will be very happy I bought it
Neko_yeetus: No I won't
Lazurus: yeah his blood sweat and tears went into the damned thing
Dtrump: I have a mold of my penos.
Lazurus: proof?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Everything can be cleaned if you have a strong enough acid

Ishipwillowandhunter: Number 1 reason I will never grow a beard 
Lazurus: lmao
Lazurus: █▀█ █▄█ ▀█▀
Ishipwillowandhunter: I learn enough about female anatomy from the women that visit my basement 
Neko_yeetus: Believe me I'd rather have a peen
Lazurus: the big no for me is that most people don't clean theirs and with a dick its easier to clean
Ishipwillowandhunter: A dick is easier to clean but no one really complains about pussy 
Ishipwillowandhunter: You can have a small dick
Neko_yeetus: It's very hard for women to figure out actually how to genuinely take care of it
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't think there's reall an equivalent for women there
Neko_yeetus: Dumbass PH imbalances
Dtrump: my flaps
Neko_yeetus: Put some women just don't fucking care and that's gross
Lazurus: yeah well I don't want to dip my dick in something that'll make it rot off
