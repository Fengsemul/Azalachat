Richnigga: this website really went to shit since i been gone
Angel_gabby: ive sent messages i meant to whisper to my bf publicly on this website more times than i can count
Dtrump: banned from this site?
Angel_gabby: how do you get banned from this site
Richnigga: idk how i even got banned in the first place
Ishipwillowandhunter: Lmao I've done that a few times before Angel
Ishipwillowandhunter: But no, I don't date or talk to people I like using this website. Not anymore
Dtrump: what now
Angel_gabby: i only use this cause its the only website i can use
Ishipwillowandhunter: And you can only get banned if you're a pedo or similar
Ishipwillowandhunter: I get that. Strict parents?
Angel_gabby: strict school
Angel_gabby: they block almost every site and it fucking sucks
Ishipwillowandhunter: Ooh, you're on a school laptop
Dtrump: good parenting
Angel_gabby: mhm
Ishipwillowandhunter: That makes sense
Richnigga: i never did any pedo shit and plus idk how they even ban you on here is there a option to report someone or something?
Angel_gabby: nope
Angel_gabby: no mods either
Ishipwillowandhunter: No, you have to get in contact with Azala himself
Dtrump: I guess that azala got a message from someone.
Richnigga: how tf did i get banned then
Angel_gabby: too bad they didnt get a message about someone else impersonating (or trying to) a mod
Ishipwillowandhunter: I also use a school laptop but I jailbroke mine a little over a year ago
Dtrump: or just an ip
Ishipwillowandhunter: + I have strict parents so I have to be careful
Angel_gabby: my parents a homophobic as fuck

Richnigga: well see yall around ima go jerk off now
Angel_gabby: based
Dtrump: Mich the things this person are saying don't make sense to me.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oof. Mine just threatened me the first-time he thought I wasnt straight
Ishipwillowandhunter: Why not Trump?
Dtrump: I feel this is someone on an alt again.

Ishipwillowandhunter: Brb one more time
Ishipwillowandhunter: backk
Angel_gabby: welcome back
Angel_gabby: its funny how one time i read trials of apollo and soon after i found out about the series
Ishipwillowandhunter: You read the Trials of Apollo first? How'd that happen?
Angel_gabby: i was in trouble i think
Angel_gabby: parents made me sit at the kitchen table and fuckin read
Dtrump: brain tume
Dtrump: r
Angel_gabby: real
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oof, I feel that though. My dad does similar shit
Ishipwillowandhunter: it's so stupid
Angel_gabby: i fully agree
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh, Angel, have you heard about CroxyProxy?
Angel_gabby: uhm, i cant say that i have
Angel_gabby: as soon as i tried to use it, it got blocked
Dtrump: cool
Ishipwillowandhunter: oops. It's supposed to be like a free VPN type thing
Angel_gabby: yeah
Ishipwillowandhunter: so you could unblock sites
Angel_gabby: my school is really strict on those
Angel_gabby: ive searched for proxies and all of them were blocked
Angel_gabby: i even went to those yt videos with a handful of links in the description
Angel_gabby: and even those never worked :/
Dtrump: Dont do that.
Ishipwillowandhunter: hold on ima try something and if it works i'll let you know how to do it
Angel_gabby: alright
Ishipwillowandhunter: It did but looking at it now, i don't know if it'd work for a managed device
Ishipwillowandhunter: uh have you tried just hard resetting your computer?
Angel_gabby: uhm, im sure it would work, but id definitely get in trouble
Ishipwillowandhunter: do you have to return the laptop to your school?
Angel_gabby: yeah, ofc
Ishipwillowandhunter: bro they let you take them home?
Ishipwillowandhunter: I thought you stole it ngl
Angel_gabby: well i guess its incase we dont have computers at home to do work
Angel_gabby: i rarely do work at home though
Dtrump: They control the computers .
Angel_gabby: plus the computers we have at home are in the attic
Angel_gabby: after i was caught sneaking them again
Dtrump: 1999 windows XP?
Angel_gabby: lenovo windows 11 laptop
Angel_gabby: from, like, idk maybe 2018
Ishipwillowandhunter: aah. Yeah, no, my dad just doesn't know I have this
Dtrump: I wouldnt touch it.
Angel_gabby: we also have gaming computers in the attic all set up, mine and dads
Angel_gabby: i rarely get to use mine cause my grades are shit
Ishipwillowandhunter: You're like me but two years younger, wtf
Angel_gabby: so 16?
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm 16, yeah. And me and my dad were like that. But like 3 months ago I had all my devices taken away. The ones he knows about, anyways.
Angel_gabby: this is the longest ive been "grounded" for
Angel_gabby: i think its been like 5 or 6 months
Angel_gabby: i havent had my oculus in so fucking long
Dtrump: I was rarely grounded by that age.
Angel_gabby: lucky
Dtrump: Shows more about your generation.
Angel_gabby: this generation sucks ass
Ishipwillowandhunter: Sameee here, my god
Ishipwillowandhunter: I've been grounded since before Thanksgiving
Angel_gabby: like what the fuck is rizz
Ishipwillowandhunter: I say grounded but really I just had most shit taken away from me because I'm not really allowed to leave the house normally anyways
Ishipwillowandhunter: you don't know? Allow me to skibidi rizz you up my ohio
Angel_gabby: skibidi toilet is definitely garbage
Angel_gabby: mainly because of fan content
Ishipwillowandhunter: I know it exists and I know it's popular. I don't get it though
Angel_gabby: speaking of which, lankybox
Angel_gabby: worst channel ever
Ishipwillowandhunter: I have no idea who that is
Angel_gabby: a stupid roblox youtuber that milks content dry
Angel_gabby: like fucking rainbow friends or garten of banban, shit like that
Angel_gabby: its annoying and obnoxious
Angel_gabby: and the two dudes, justin and adam, both act like they snort a line of cocaine before every video
Ishipwillowandhunter: ew what the fuck
Ishipwillowandhunter: I just went to shorts and that's all I needed to know
Angel_gabby: mhm
Angel_gabby: their worst short tho
Ishipwillowandhunter: I won't watch enough to find out
Angel_gabby: is like, this spider saying "hey, watch this, i have skibidi rizz"
Angel_gabby: and telling the viewers to like to turn justin and adam into skibidi toilets
Ishipwillowandhunter: Alright, that's it. I'm killing myself
Ishipwillowandhunter: Please for the love of God, you're making Satan cry
Angel_gabby: and then the spider fucking "rizzes up" banbaleena from garten of bongbong, which is apparently adams crush
Angel_gabby: like who the fuck would ever like anyone that looks like that
Angel_gabby: she looks goofy af

Ishipwillowandhunter: She looks like a mutated sperm on crack
Dtrump: is that you
Ishipwillowandhunter: Trump I will do things to you with coconut oil
Dtrump: sorry
Angel_gabby: my mind after hearing the word "coconut"
Angel_gabby: https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQNtdGrtkRsvWbE6hhKZqnBvxabBxfJdPkBgN-rklxLpU_3F0xlJUEHUKs:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6e/Coconut_Fred%2527s_Fruit_Salad_Island.jpg/220px-Coconut_Fred%2527s_Fruit_Salad_Island.jpg&s
Angel_gabby: no joke this fucking show pops up in my mind every time i hear "coconut"
Dtrump: scary
Angel_gabby: i honestly dont see how its a spongebob ripoff, minus the fact they took some gags from the show
Ishipwillowandhunter: I've never watched it, I don't even know what that show is
Angel_gabby: honestly, i wished it went on longer
Ishipwillowandhunter: I feel that way about The Owl House
Ishipwillowandhunter: and Gravity Falls
Angel_gabby: omg same
Angel_gabby: especially gravity falls
Ishipwillowandhunter: I remember being 8 and binging Gravity Falls over and over, tryna break the codes. I got it on dvd and everything
Angel_gabby: my favorite was the backwards message in the finale
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh the "Axolotl, my time has come to burn" one?
Angel_gabby: yea that one
Angel_gabby: i remember when i was like, 8, and putting the audio through a reverser and being astonished hearing the audio
Ishipwillowandhunter: I really wish there were more canon explanations to that. To the Axolotl
Angel_gabby: i think there was a book for GF that had an axolotl in it
Ishipwillowandhunter: oh yeah there was
Ishipwillowandhunter: there's a few pieces of media that contain pictures/writing
Ishipwillowandhunter: but not much
Angel_gabby: heres a small piece of text i could see from the website preview
Angel_gabby: The Axolotl is a powerful extra-dimensional creature whose power ranks massively above that of Time Baby, Bill Cipher, and other types of powerful ...
Angel_gabby: https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTwB4ZpvreyGScjr9b1V9lWNsjc-bwDvAUCzRg5XldDzi9CcpSuH31TMGM:https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gravityfalls/images/6/6e/CotTPT_Axolotl.jpg/revision/latest%3Fcb%3D20170516011110&s
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yep, I've seen it before. I want to know it's origins, though.
Ishipwillowandhunter: I want to know what it is, exactly
Ishipwillowandhunter: Does it have origins?
Angel_gabby: im not exactly sure
Angel_gabby: heres the link to the fandom page
Angel_gabby: https://gravityfalls.fandom.com/wiki/Axolotl
Ishipwillowandhunter: Does it have limitations? Does it create them? aiafpaeafo so many questions, so few answers.
Angel_gabby: questions*
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh, and apparently the Bill Cipher AMA is canon. Bill Cipher has family
Ishipwillowandhunter: Or he did. "Do you have family?" "NOT ANYMORE"
Angel_gabby: yeah
Angel_gabby: i like the thought of the 2d dimension being his home dimension because lore coud come from it
Angel_gabby: could*
Dtrump: snooker
Angel_gabby: huh
Dtrump: cool word
Angel_gabby: sounds like a adjective given so a silly lil goober
Angel_gabby: to*
Dtrump: idk I'm white
Angel_gabby: same
Ishipwillowandhunter: That could be true but he could also hail from a dimension we can't see or realistically process. The way a 2d character couldn't understand a 3d world.
Angel_gabby: yeah
Angel_gabby: also that one song from shrek is canon in the gf universe cause ford got a tattoo that says "hey now, im an all star" i think
Dtrump: You know a lot.
Angel_gabby: mhm, i have the books
Ishipwillowandhunter: Gravity Falls is amazing. I sadly don't but i'm pretty sure i've consumed every bit of Gravity Falls media there is
Angel_gabby: same
Angel_gabby: theres so many codes and shit i probably wont ever unscramble
Angel_gabby: especially that blendin letter
Angel_gabby: there is a website that i like to play around with though
Angel_gabby: https://themysteryofgravityfalls.com/
Ishipwillowandhunter: Gravity Falls is the sole reason I ever learned ciphers at all. There are a million reasons one would want to learn to decode something and Gravity Falls is the only one I care about. But I'm not getting sucked back into Gravity Falls tonight
Angel_gabby: lol
Angel_gabby: i also remember figuring out codes myself because i found out the numbers correspond to the number of the letter or smth
Ishipwillowandhunter: Lmao I did the same, a few years back actually when I went back to the show. I was 12 or something with just a bunch of papers scattered around me and ink on my hands. Good times.
Angel_gabby: while we're on the topic of favorite fandoms (or franchises, i dont know what to call them), i have a lot of fandoms
Angel_gabby: like for instance, angel hare
Angel_gabby: or batim
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm a big fan of the Mandela Catalogues. Batim is good too. Welcome Home is great, and ongoing so that's cool. God, there's so much. pawihaoruaht I need to do something else or ima be looking back on old series all night
Angel_gabby: ive got a list of fandoms that i like or love
Angel_gabby: walten files, bugbo, poppy playtime (i especially love chapter 3)
Ishipwillowandhunter: Walten Files is great, I was heavy into them a few weeks ago. And Poppy Playtime is one of my favorites
Angel_gabby: also im one of those people that if i see any official plushies from one of my fandoms, i get excited
Angel_gabby: https://i.kickstarter.com/assets/043/726/590/9a184d411ca115f874d9f0988f63dd34_original.jpg?anim=false&fit=cover&gravity=auto&height=576&origin=ugc&q=92&width=1024&sig=qfDoFafzQaRGBb%2FNweT2jZ%2BPZh4rkKK0XHjy%2BZLJgKg%3D
Angel_gabby: i want these for my bday so badlyyy
Angel_gabby: hopefully they make a francis plush too
Ishipwillowandhunter: I've not got into it like that so I don't know too much. If I get the time tomorrow to really watch/research I will
Ishipwillowandhunter: Favorite video game though?
Angel_gabby: hmm
Angel_gabby: friday night funkin
Angel_gabby: mainly its mods
Angel_gabby: also i gotta restart my chromebook rq, for some stupid reason, so brb ig
Ishipwillowandhunter: kk
Angel_gabby: alright, im back now
Angel_gabby: i almost forgot one fandom
Angel_gabby: bluey
Angel_gabby: one of my absolute favorites
Dtrump: oh no
Angel_gabby: what?
Ishipwillowandhunter: kBluey?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Also welcome back
Ishipwillowandhunter: I know what Bluey is but I can't imagine there's much depth to it
Dtrump: someone like blueys who
Angel_gabby: im such a fan that i got a talking plushie (it doesnt work anymore though because i put it in the washer) and some figures
Ishipwillowandhunter: I know a few people that really like Bluey for some reason. I'll watch it occasionally but only if it's 6am and I want to turn my brain off. What's so good about it?
Angel_gabby: for me, its the art style
Angel_gabby: and its enjoyable by adults too
Angel_gabby: enjoyed*
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't see it but I also can't really judge
Angel_gabby: yeah
Angel_gabby: the shit i can judge is rule34 artists when it comes to bluey
Angel_gabby: or any porn artist
Dtrump: porn artiis
Ishipwillowandhunter: I tend to stay away from anything rule34, nasty community. At least, it is from my experience
Angel_gabby: ive seen some shit
Angel_gabby: actual people sat down and drew porn of 6 and 4 year old dogs
Dtrump: why did you watch
Angel_gabby: i wanted to know if anyone was insane enough to make that shit
Angel_gabby: and in fact, they are
Angel_gabby: and the fact some people were justifying jerking off to it-
Angel_gabby: like god
Ishipwillowandhunter: Ew, really?
Ishipwillowandhunter: That's... yeah, hell naw
Dtrump: were they men
Angel_gabby: theres so many people that should not be allowed near children within a 2 mile radius
Angel_gabby: yea
Angel_gabby: probably all men
Dtrump: well they should be in jail than
Angel_gabby: no, prison
Dtrump: why prison and not jail
Angel_gabby: idk which one is more long term
Angel_gabby: was it prison?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Jail holds people that are either awaiting trial or serving super short sentences. Prisons are much larger and usually house those that have committed much more serious crimes
Angel_gabby: yep, definitely prison then
Dtrump: Yeah prison is correct my bad.
Angel_gabby: honestly, death row
Angel_gabby: cause that might as well be pedophilism and zoophilism at the same time
Ishipwillowandhunter: Honestly I'd rather have them beating it to fictional children than real children
Angel_gabby: honestly kinda fair

(anon): Grind up 150 grams of Morning Glory seeds or baby Hawaiian wood rose seeds.
In 130 cc. of petroleum ether, soak the seeds for two days.
Filter the solution through a tight screen.
Throw away the liquid, and allow the seed mush to dry.
For two days allow the mush to soak in 110 cc. of wood alcohol.
Filter the solution again, saving the liquid and labeling it 1.
Resoak the mush in 110 cc. of wood alcohol for two days
(anon): Filter and throw away the mush
Add the liquid from the second soak to the solution labeled 1.
Pour the liquid into a cookie tray and allow it to evaporate.When all of the liquid has evaporated, a yellow gum remains. This should be scraped up and
put into capsules.
â€¢ 30 grams of Morning Glory seeds = 1 trip
â€¢ 15 Hawaiian wood rose seeds = 1 trip

Marz_the_fri: why stay if u dont care
Marz_the_fri: lol
Paperus: It's not safe here
Marz_the_fri: i know
Marz_the_fri: so why stay?

Marz_the_fri: ive been here for a year now

Paperus: Waiting till anyone listens in this void? There are more productive ways
Marz_the_fri: well, nobody at school likes me, and im groundd from my phone soo

Marz_the_fri: i can actually talk to ppl who understand my problems
Thebohemianjointpuffer: no one understands me

Paperus: See? No one understands Bohemian here. So how does continue staying in chat help further? None.

Thebohemianjointpuffer: I'm here because my hubby be here and I want him

Dtrump: Rules are rules.
Cum52: what'd i miss
Izzy_blight: I never knew there were rules
Cum52: Did she kill jimmy??!?!?
Cum52: Jimmy became a potassium junkie, shooting up every day to the point where he felt his body was about to fall apart, his joints started to ache and his eyes felt like they were going to pop. His kidneys gave out 1,000 times a month, his liver gave out about 100 times a month, his heart gave out about 200 times a day, his lungs died, his lymph glands shut down and his dick started shrinking and he was coughing up blood and he had constant diarrhea every few hours.
Izzy_blight: Maybe
Izzy_blight: Classic Jimmy
Dtrump: gosh this joke is overdone
Cum52: Jimmy woke up in the middle of the night and stumbled down the stairs and collapsed. He died instantly. His fat, naked corpse was not discovered until five weeks later. The medical examiner declared his death the result of massive amounts of potassium being pumped into his veins. Jimmy's autopsy revealed that he had taken a whopping 6,900 mg of potassium a day, for seven years.
Izzy_blight: It certainly is But it's funny to me
Cum52: Yiff_mommy: nobody tell him i told yall, but riley pissed himself in his sleep once...while I was cuddling with him =/

Angel_gabby: Mhm.

Raul_menendez: That's a start in my books
Izzy_blight: I guess. I don't think I'll be able to do it again soon though. Just when it seemed like life had some semblance of security again it was ripped away. And now I have no choice but to be back here unless things Change again
Raul_menendez: what happened?

Ratio: long to live in a chic Pee-Weeâ€™s Playhouse 
Izzy_blight: I like cheesecake
Izzy_blight: I want to live at the Holiday Inn
Tempex: no you like pee pee
Ratio: Paul Reubens, who gave us the unforgettable character of Pee-wee Herman, has died of cancer at age 70. 
Izzy_blight: Oh no
Ratio: As the star of â€œPee-weeâ€™s Playhouse,â€ Reubens inspired a generation of kids â€” and adults â€” to dream and think outside the box, and to feel worthy of subversive, funny, unique art. And he was, according to those who knew him best, warm, loving, generous and a purveyor of one-of-a-kind, bountiful happy birthday messages.
Izzy_blight: Only sometimes
Izzy_blight: Very sad. Didn't he get caught jerking off in a dirty porno theater
Tempex: pee wee herman pee oee
Izzy_blight: 
Dan and Phil won dads of the year 
Ratio: Paul Reubens never got the critical reappraisal he deserved
Tempex: bro im gonna touch you 
Izzy_blight: Poor guy
Izzy_blight: Hey that's what my uncle said
Rain69: i give up
Ratio: And so when Reubens was handcuffed on charges of public indecency at Sarasota, Floridaâ€™s pornographic South Trail Cinema in 1991, his rangy-haired, rough-night mugshot became both punch line and scarlet letter. 
Izzy_blight: Never give up John Cena
Izzy_blight: Oh man
Tempex: yea i just got gropped by my teacher
Izzy_blight: Oh shit I'm sorry
Tempex: its okay i liked it
Ratio: I just learned today Reubens was charged in 2001 for possessing child pornography (photos of a 17 year old) and pled guilty.
Izzy_blight: oh........
Ratio: However, he was not convicted of that crime, exactly. Roughly two years after the charge, in 2004, prosecutors agreed to drop the child pornography charge in exchange for Reuben's guilty plea to a less severe misdemeanor obscenity charge. 
Izzy_blight: wow
Ratio: California law criminalizes the possession, and control of, any matter or image depicting a person under the age of 18 engaging in, or simulating, sexual conduct.
Izzy_blight: I did not know that and I regret learning it
Ratio: Reubens' legal team disagreed with the city's definition of child pornography. They maintained the items in question were antique art works without any sexual undertones. While they acknowledged the materials featured nudity, they claimed it was unknown whether the subjects were under the age of 18. 
Tempex: damn
Izzy_blight: Oh. huh
Izzy_blight: Not sure what to think about that
Ratio: "[Claims by a prosecutor] mischaracterizes the art collection seized," Berk said in response to city attorney spokesman Eric Moses' claim that images showed minors with exposed genitals. "If [child pornography] means a black-and-white tintype from 1901, with a young man of indeterminate,
Ratio:  17- to 19-year-old age, laying on the beach after having gone skinny-dipping, [â€¦] then they got it. [...] It was clear from the start that we, along with the many distinguished art experts supporting Paul's art photography collection, vehemently disagreed with the city prosecutor's view of what constitutes art." 
Tempex: holy shit who  are you taling about 
Izzy_blight: Is it still child porn if it's artistic and tasteful child porn?
Ratio: In March 2004, Reubens pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charge of possessing obscene material, including obscene images of minors. Moses said, with that plea, Reubens' legal team acknowledged possessing 170 images of minors engaged in sexual conduct, AP reported.
Daddydalton: Iâ€™m gonna commit Jeffery Dahmer on a person
Izzy_blight: 170????
Tempex: me me 
Izzy_blight: What the actual fuck
Izzy_blight: No no one is getting eaten
Ratio: In an NBC interview shortly following his guilty plea, Reubens maintained that his art collection was not child pornography:

Phillips: Did you ever stop and think while you were massing this collection, maybe it's not such a good idea, especially given what had happened back in 1991?
Ratio: Reubens: I didn't. I never did. I wasn't really thinking to myself, wow this is my creepy, weird stuff that I shouldn't be collecting. It's not titillating. It's not something that I use for any kind of sexual purpose.

Phillips: Is it sensual, erotic to you, you acknowledge that?
Ratio: Reubens: I think some of it is erotic. Some of it is sensual. Most of it I don't view like that.  It seems so innocent to me. You would immediately look at that collection and to tell very, very, very quickly this is not a collection of child pornography.
Lion247: w h a t
Cautiouscash: Fucking Steven so god damn hard that his momma can feel it.
Ratio: end of interview: Reubens: Personally, I think we're living in a very scary time. Do we let the legal system decide in a courtroom what's obscene and what's not obscene? I didn't want be in a situation where there was a possibility I could got to jail for something that's that material. I mean, that just seemed insane to me.
Izzy_blight: I'm not sure where I should stand on this
Cautiouscash: wtf
Ratio: In sum, while the above posts about Reuben being charged with possessing child pornography were correct, they missed important details of the complex case â€” including the fact that the charge was eventually dropped in exchange for his guilty plea to a lesser misdemeanor of possessing obscene images that included images of minors.
Ratio: While a debate over the nature of the in-question items remains unresolved, with prosecutors calling them child pornography and Reubens' legal team describing the materials as art, Reubens was never convicted of possessing child pornography.
Izzy_blight: He got away with it and he ain't never going to be convicted now
Izzy_blight: Good job Lad
Tempex: pee pee 
Cautiouscash: art thats crazy

Zoomers: Press X to doubt

Ratio: Reubensâ€™s 1991 arrest on the absurd charge of â€œindecent exposureâ€ because he was caught masturbating during a screening in an adult film theater in Sarasota, Florida â€” Reubensâ€™s hometown
Izzy_blight: That's my boy
Izzy_blight: I masturbate five times a day i hope to follow in his footsteps

Izzy_blight: The dream is dead :{

Izzy_blight: I have a Polish last name but I can't speak Polish :(
Ratio: Learning a New Language: It improves cognitive skills and brain plasticity, enhancing problem-solving and multitasking abilities.
Izzy_blight: I tried to learn a couple of languages but I gave up because I'm lazy
Ratio: Studies have shown that bilingual individuals often perform better on tasks that require focus, flexibility, and task switching. So not you prob
Foap: your someone named Izzy, ofc you'd be lazy ;-;
Izzy_blight: Have you ever met a girl named Izzy who was a good person
Izzy_blight: A sane and functional human being
Izzy_blight: Because I have not
Foap: not really
17:37:28Monday, 6 May, 2024
Foap: that includes yourself >:|
Izzy_blight: Yes I am aware
Izzy_blight: I am a trainwreck
Izzy_blight: Luckily I'll be dead in hopefully a few years
Izzy_blight: And then everyone can be happy
Foap: Y...
Foap: I wont be happy ._.
Izzy_blight: I guess no one really will be
Foap: I would be
Izzy_blight: But I like to tell myself that the world would be better without me somehow
Izzy_blight: Oh okay
Foap: if you were to disappear, I wouldn't be a happy camper ._.
Ratio: This is an individual that was just recently hit by the system. This has been the long story of Izzy_blight, which is a story of a trainwreck
Izzy_blight: Yay
Izzy_blight: Reminds me of the train scene in call of Duty World War II
Izzy_blight: That scene was very unnecessary
Foap: oh 0-0

Izzy_blight: very important
Ratio: Snoop Dogg, T-Pain perform and Him canceling last minute 
Izzy_blight: Canceled my Geico Insurance
Ratio: It reflects a willingness to improve a situation despite lacking full clarity on the wrongdoing, a scenario that might not always satisfy all parties involved. Understanding and trust is important.
Ratio: Two of the most famous products of Berkeley are LSD and Unix. I donâ€™t think that is a coincidence.
Izzy_blight: I think not
Flipshak: Whoever thinks, let him speak. Whoever would muzzle another, let him stay his hand. Bring on the opposition. Let it be heard. Then shall we have all the forces in full play.
Ratio: These are noble and inspiring words; well, just what do they mean? I am not asking what they mean to Mr. Russell.
Ifuckinghatedykes: fucking kys 
Rain69: okay
Ratio: If I might do so, I would ask Mr. Russellâ€™s permission to place myself beside him in that category.
Izzy_blight: I plan to
Foapy: already tried over a dozen times 
Ratio: because it is amusing, but also because it tends somewhat to show what I am driving at.
Rain69: if it dont hapen now it will later
Ratio: Is that the way you people generally feel about it?
Izzy_blight: I am sorry
Izzy_blight: very sorry
Izzy_blight: I feel
Izzy_blight: Like a plastic bag
Rain69: i am a plastic bag weird looking and filled with bs
Izzy_blight: Who is Ryder and why does he have a creamy deck for me
Izzy_blight: You are a beautiful shining star
Rain69: nah 
Ratio: Izzy_blightâ€™s death was a shocking thing, truly,â€ I said, â€œbut let us try to strike a balance. Donâ€™t you think, when all comes to all, that the life of Izzy_blight, now and then, maybe, â€“ such things seldom happen, â€“ a moderate price for keeping you free of a civilization made up half of fools and half of hypocrites? Men have thought so before now, and pretty good men too.
Izzy_blight: That's that's deep
Rain69: ohh do me
Ratio: That sounds rather cold-blooded, but the immense augmentation and strengthening of the social forces in all areas in the past fifty years go far to show that they were right. 
Ratio: Izzy's mom did a mistake and it follows even more.
Izzy_blight: I was a mistake
Izzy_blight: and many people have paid for it
Ratio: To be on the popular side at the moment is not especially interesting; the thing is to be on the right side in the long run.
Izzy_blight: Very true
Ratio: A degeneracy in these is a canker which soon eats to the heart of this people and azala.info as a whole.
Izzy_blight: A bunch of little psychopaths rotting away their youth on this site
Izzy_blight: That's what we are oh baby
Ratio: The English language is of course against us. Its vocabulary is so large, it is so rich in synonyms, it lends itself so easily and naturally to paraphrase, that one gets up a great facility with indirection almost without knowing it.
Izzy_blight: I don't words
Ratio: Kent. A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered, action-taking whoreson, glass-gazing, & super-servicable, finical rogue; onetrunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar, and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch.
Izzy_blight: Hey that sounds like me
Izzy_blight: But in a very medieval way
Ratio: Kent is not abusing Oswald; he is merely, as we say, â€œtelling him.â€
Izzy_blight: Imagine being named Oswald
Ratio: it brings Jeremy Bentham back to mind, with his chapter on what he calls â€œimpostor-terms.â€
Izzy_blight: Imposter? Among us?
Ratio: Albert Jay Nock (1870â€“1945) was an influential American libertarian author, educational theorist, and social critic. Now he's dead.
Izzy_blight: Hooray!
Ratio: Canâ€™t you hear Albert's voice growing quieter and quieter, colder and colder, deadlier and deadlier, all the way through that passage?
Izzy_blight: I got caught venting
Izzy_blight: Oh heavens. I'm afraid I don't hear sogood
Ratio: 50 Times Men exposed venting
Izzy_blight: Among us compilation
Izzy_blight: Funny moments lol
Ratio: adapting your life (or some version of it) into scripted series.
Izzy_blight: I would do that if I could remember my own life from moment to moment. I have the ego for it
Ratio: Instead, weâ€™re writing on a web page that can control and watch your doings as an autopilot running in JS that, in turn, controls a little share of your time.
Izzy_blight: I wonder if this site is filled with Chinese spyware
Izzy_blight: That would be pretty epic
Izzy_blight: I wonder if the Chinese have seen every time I've sent nudes
Ratio: Background: Accusations of spyware from China have historically centered around allegations of state-sponsored espionage. These concerns are amplified by global geopolitical tensions and cybersecurity incidents attributed to Chinese actors 
Ratio: Given these complexities, one must approach the issue with a critical eye, examining both the sources of the claims and the broader context in which they arise. Without specific evidence or official verification tying a website directly to covert operations by Chinese entities, the assertion remains speculative.
Izzy_blight: Interesting
Ratio: also the FDA approved 55 new drugs
Izzy_blight: I'm going to reject the con text and assume there is Chinese malware on my computer. Oh boy I love drugs i do heroin everyday
Ratio: While accusations do exist, proving the presence of spyware specifically from a certain country often remains challenging without concrete forensic evidence. Transparency and verifiable sources, such as secure .gov websites, are crucial in confirming the legitimacy of such claims
Izzy_blight: The American government is in cahoots with the Chinese
Izzy_blight: I just know it
Ratio: According to a TechRepublic article dated May 03, 2024, cybersecurity threats are a global issue, involving not only China, but also other geopolitical entities like Russia
Ratio: https://www.techrepublic.com/article/pro-russia-hacktivists-target-operational-technology/
Ratio: On the topic of drug usage, particularly heroin, this remains a significant public health issue. The BBC's findings, dated April 22, 2024, highlight the emergence of synthetic drugs, like nitazenes, which are even more potent than heroin and often originate from China
Izzy_blight: Oh fun
Izzy_blight: Let's get wrecked on Chinese synth drugs
Ratio: A report released Tuesday by a House select committee says China is directly subsidizing the manufacturing of materials used by drug traffickers to make fentanyl outside the country.
Izzy_blight: Damn China
Izzy_blight: Drinking fentanyl laced cereal milk. I see God
Ratio: The resurgence of hip-hop in China has marked a significant journey from suppression to prominence. In 2018, Chinese censors imposed restrictions on hip-hop.
Izzy_blight: Oh no not Chinese death grips
Ratio: Drug dealers offer BBC team deadly opioids and Mexico's meth trade has become so lucrative it is exported as far away as Hong Kong or Australia
Raul_menendez: hi
Izzy_blight: Jesus Christ
