Ishipwillowandhunter: That's the issue, with most guys including myself. If she wants it then she can have it, so long as she still loves me.  My soul? Why not, it wasn't heavily guarded anyways. She could cry as much as she wanted and I'd just be happy to be there for her. She could curse me out and hit me and I would still just be happy she touches me. She could scream at me in the next life and I would smile, because she followed me

Ishipwillowandhunter: So
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm going to try my hand at writing a genuine book
Ishipwillowandhunter: but I want to be original. Corny but original 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Enemies to lovers type story
Ishipwillowandhunter: My idea right now, they meet at a fight club and start as enemies. backstory for each yeah but that's the main part
Inasg_no: interesting
Roper: Genuinety and originality doesn't matter in 2024, especially when sensationalist perfect fake. Only TikTok-like segments.
Izzy_blight: I am Jack's emotional liability
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm trying to think of things that would appeal to the audience of the website i'll be writing on
Ishipwillowandhunter: that whole enemies to lovers thing is perfect
Ishipwillowandhunter: and yeah originality is as dead as genuine romance but it matters to me
Roper: I would write a book where ethnicity and victim role plays strongly, since most readers can identify that. The protagonist is a hot milf feminist who kills herself because of ugly rapist. The second half of book is how her adopted Asian daughter try's to revenge and having flashbacks of her anestors's slave trade.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Roper wha
Roper: What? Liberarians are left-leaning. I don't think your book has success
Izzy_blight: My head hurts so much what is going on 
Roper: My opinion is that the simple enemy vs enemy vs lover dynamic is overused. I wrote a suggestion as to how their book looks more exciting.
Dtrump: all words no substance
Roper: shipwillowandhunter: I'm trying to think of things that would appeal to the audience of the website i'll be writing on - Politics, race, oppression, history. Ishipwillowandhunter: that whole enemies to lovers thing is perfect - Boring.
Roper: Ishipwillowandhunter: and yeah originality is as dead as genuine romance but it matters to me - Well then West African X North Korean. She escaped North Korea, they meet in USA > black male died > son finds out he was accident and destroys everything around him, just to revenge and learn about Buddhist forgiveness

Izzy_blight: I'm about to get so many viruses downloading from the sketchiest site ever, cant wait to brick my laptop
Ishipwillowandhunter: why are you downloading 
Roper: 1. How do you know it's word, so you read 0.00001%? 2. I go for the politics direction with disappointed couples with broken nuclear family and their consequences of having children who starts doing moral dilemmas for their twisted conception of their autobiographical past, which is what the Top 3 Selled Books in The New Yorker is about
Izzy_blight: Downloading what may or may not be porn. It's either porn or 200 viruses. 50/50

Roper: *pretends to know what's going on* Yes.
Izzy_blight: You get curious about the worst things. Admittedly so do I
Roper: What's the solution to the Jewish Question? Just curious

Inasg_no: I'm a fucking she

Inasg_no: Tyty
Izzy_blight: I didn't get my porn. I think I got scammed. I might have found cp by accident
Ishipwillowandhunter: Well.
Izzy_blight: It got deleted so I'll never know 
Izzy_blight: Hopefully it wasn't 
Ishipwillowandhunter: why download again, I forget your logic
Roper: Having porn twice a day, keeps the doctor away
Izzy_blight: I'm delirious and on the brink of death and extremely horny for no real reason 
Izzy_blight: I am operating on base instincts and little else at thisp oint
Roper: Zoomer-Nihilism
Izzy_blight: It's not so bad. My higher brain functions are too obliterated to care anymore that I've been being ignored for half the night. I have very little capacity for feelings other than lust and emptiness
Izzy_blight: Actually no i take that back it's pretty bad.i feel like I'm gonna throw up
Roper: And with what brain function are you typing this?
Izzy_blight: Idk
Izzy_blight: Stupidity 
Izzy_blight: autism
Izzy_blight: Retardardation
Roper: And yet all of them are true
Dtrump: stfu

Roper: Go to a doctor if I were you.
Izzy_blight: Trumpy dumpy why you so grumpyyy
Izzy_blight: Hahaaa

Izzy_blight: I am the doctor
Dtrump: roper is a cunt
Izzy_blight: Roper is a ropist
Izzy_blight: Whatever that involves 

Roper: Hoping your complex biological and therefore psychological problems being solved in a shady chat full of strangers is dumb. Get professional help.

Izzy_blight: So they tell me. I know i need therapist. maybe eventually. If I decide im worth it
Ishipwillowandhunter: i'm extremely tired

Roper: I hope whoever knows you real life takes care of you. You waste your time here hoping.
Izzy_blight: Wow really I can't imagine why 

Izzy_blight: Nobody.no one gives a fuck abouut me

Roper: Then try to make anyone give a damn about you

Izzy_blight: I try, doesnt work

Roper: Being here doesn't work either

Izzy_blight: It is what it is 

Roper: What do you have to do to think you're worth of paying therapy?

Izzy_blight: Be cleansed of all my sins and be a sweet baby girl 

Roper: Give up that fantasy. We will never know if God forgive us till we die

Izzy_blight: Fantasy is all I've got left. My delusions are me
Roper: You threatened to kill yiurself anyway. Why not doing it mentally to become a better self? Dark, right?

Izzy_blight: I've tried to lose everything and let go. But I've only ever found more regrets and to lose

Izzy_blight: more to lose

Roper: lose it step-to-step. Not extreme. Ask why you regret? Maybe you don't hate yourself that much?

Izzy_blight: I've been doing the step by step process of dismantling my life for a long time. I don't feel any freer. I regret what I've done to others in my quest to hit bottom. I hate myself more every day 

Roper: If you want to become just happy, reduce your standards and smile now. Enjoying existence itself. Yeah it's hard, yet who doesn't make irreversible mistakes?

Izzy_blight: My life motto is, "don't smile because it's over, cry because it happened." I thought it was funny at first. It was a joke. But it definitely suits me. I can enjoy the little things, yes. But the intrusive thoughts always come back 

Roper: You can be glad of all the emotions and thoughts you have, instead rejecting it. That makes you you. Real friends are long-term healthier then Internet friends. You have to do it or get more mental illnesses. Even changing yourself despite everything, you're still yourself. Sorry idk. You seem to have hard time forgetting things

Izzy_blight: That's an understatement. I am haunted in every waking moment by insecurities, horrible memories and dreams that will never come true. Maybe if i could finally forget i could work on putting myself out there. But I don't know how to forget 

Izzy_blight: I've considered alcoholism, drugs or suicide as future options 

Roper: Hey I know a YouTuber who may have more mental illnesses than you. JReg. He claimed to cured himself irony poisoning and mental illnesses https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=okwieOwV-nk . If you have much free-time, you can watch his videos related to your problems. Consider wacky YouTubers aswell.

Whitetrashfucker: Where are they?
Whitetrashfucker: I need names and addresses 
Roper: Idk. Inside me
Whitetrashfucker: Oh 
Whitetrashfucker: Mental illness?
Roper: UwU
Whitetrashfucker: Oh yeah mental illness lol
Whitetrashfucker: Anyone who says UwU has a diseased brain 
Roper: I mean, they pay high to live safe from their illnesses 
Whitetrashfucker: There is no escape that money can but 
Whitetrashfucker: Buy
Whitetrashfucker: There is someone in their head but it ain‚Äôt them
Roper: They can increase likelihood of survival
Whitetrashfucker: So what 
Whitetrashfucker: They live longer lives of quiet desperation and despair 
Roper: Thats the best thing they can do. Paying the police when they get caught
Whitetrashfucker: That‚Äôs awesome 
Roper: Is there a medicine against stupidity? Because a certain guy needs it now. He wants to live
Whitetrashfucker: The medicine for stupidity is a book
Whitetrashfucker: Try reading 
Roper: What book do you read? They are too boring
Whitetrashfucker: The books aren‚Äôt too boring 
Whitetrashfucker: The person reading them is too stupid 
Roper: Do you read The Republic or what's ur fav
Whitetrashfucker: The Republic wtf Plato?
Whitetrashfucker: That isn‚Äôt a book you dumbass

Whitetrashfucker: Some blood and guts 
Roper: But is The Republic a collection of written dialogs from Plato? Or what does "The Republic" it refer to?
Roper: Or between Plato and Socrates exactly
Whitetrashfucker: I would start them with Armor by John Steakley
Whitetrashfucker: Classic military science fiction 
Whitetrashfucker: Very exciting and well written 
Roper: You said The Republic isn't a book right? What is it then?
Whitetrashfucker: The novel wasn‚Äôt developed until like the late 1700s
Whitetrashfucker: The Republic would be considered an essay of some kind or a manual 
Whitetrashfucker: Like The Enchiridion is a manual of Stoicism 
Roper: There's a book called The Republic. https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1497/1497-h/1497-h.htm Fair enough. Yet as a layman, I mean The Republic as book on amazon, not the original script
SHOW IMAGE

Whitetrashfucker: I‚Äôve read Armor several dozen times 
Roper: We live in different "worlds"
Whitetrashfucker: I don‚Äôt watch tv or memes
Whitetrashfucker: Tv is dumb 
Whitetrashfucker: Memes are for teenagers

Roper: I cast a black. He died
Izzy_blight: I cast spell of jimmification
Roper: I wish Hitler won WW2 so that they could gas all the Jimmys
Roper: There's humans, subhumans and there's the lowest of them all: Jimmys
Izzy_blight: Facts
Roper: The only reason why some ppl are still racial realist, because of Jimmy's degeneracy
Izzy_blight: I like when Jimmy makes my nip nips get excited 
Roper: Are you... glorifying the Jimmy?
Roper: You know what, let's give him rights too. Whatever I will die anyway
Izzy_blight: I want to send nudes to cinder
Roper: Is this really what you want?
Izzy_blight: No, but my brain is located somewhere south of my waistline right now 
Roper: Imagine a world, where you already did this. How would you feel?
Izzy_blight: Bad. Very bad
Izzy_blight: But im horny
Roper: But horny is just an emotion. It is your choices that matters. Just jerk that horniness off elsewhere
Prob: Hey
Roper: Ong new character added
Roper: hi
Izzy_blight: Hey youre right feller
Prob: What‚Äôs up
Roper: Hey Prob, do you have any professions or special abilities being relevant to stop a girl from making something she regrets?
Prob: I don‚Äôt think so but it depends on what she‚Äôs making then my persuasion skill can be increased or decreased
Roper: Izzy wants to send nudes to Cinder because she's horny. But after doing this, she feels bad. How to stop her doing bad?
Roper: Roper: Is this really what you want?
Izzy_blight: No, but my brain is located somewhere south of my waistline right now 
Prob: By telling her about post nut clarity and the fickle thing that it is
Izzy_blight: I've really lost myself lately. What am i doing? These thoughts. The horny is reaching new lows
Roper: Idk female details, but yeah I told her to jerk off somewhere else
Roper: What's that fickle thing?
Prob: I get it, I‚Äôm always horny but I try to just look at porn when possible 
Roper: So after you cum, you watch porn out of force of habit?
Izzy_blight: I touched myself twice already this morning but I'm still ravenous
Izzy_blight: I have a problem 
Prob: No I stop watching porn after I cum but sometimes I‚Äôll be back like an hour later to jack off again
Roper: And that has that name? I call it reload or regeneration in Cum context
Prob: We‚Äôll post but clarity is just feeling bad about masturbating after you cum
Izzy_blight: Reload the yogurt cannon 
Roper: So feeling bad after Cum because of you raping yourself is fickle thing?
Prob: If that‚Äôs how you wanna word it, sure?
Roper: Or you feel bad because of how exhausting cumming was, like running 1 km and then almost vomit
Roper: The entire fapping was too exhausting 
Prob: I guess you pick which one you feel works better
Roper: My dick above my anus. Haha
Izzy_blight: My girlhood is trembling. I need to drain it again
Izzy_blight: Back in like 10 minutes
Roper: Imagine being horny and on period
Prob: Uh ohhh it‚Äôs fingering time
Roper: Let her go

Roper: Horseshoe theory

Roper: No difference
Izzy_blight: Or isthere
Izzy_blight: Im so tired idk whats even going on anymore 
Roper: There is. Luck means probability in favor of positive outcome. Probability is neutral. I said "no difference" as Horseshoe reference.
Izzy_blight: Oh make s sense. Im dumb and fat and gay
Roper: Oh , hi Izzy from the future. If you read this, then you really messed up this time. Now your nudes are all over the chat thx to Cinder for free!? Sticking in a negative loop, the escape is to mature and master self-control since your parents abandoned their role. Become your best parent.

Oofalladeez: its file box dude
Roper: So no video. Well, what did you got?
Oofalladeez: Megalovania
Oofalladeez: Holder Remix
Roper: Oh. Well it's weird that .. Oh yeah you said it's just a file, even though that has MP4 too
Oofalladeez: try downloading it
Roper: My school computer sucks
Oofalladeez: 8.5 MB
Izzy_blight: Jimmy fell down and went bam boom boom bang ow
Roper: Well, it's du-du-duh du-du-dududu but 2 X speed, higher-pitched and like pipe sounds
Oofalladeez: I like this version better
Oofalladeez: its like 32-bit Megalovania
Oofalladeez: instead of 8-bit
Roper: The DJ beat part at the end is best
Roper: You know how sans-fangirls are adoptive to changes, almost none except it's about sex
Roper: Or mainstream in general. Classic triumphs Updated corrected version
Roper: Classic 8-bit trumps 32-bit nuanced high art.
Roper: The cycle of life, except your favorite bear is excluded
Izzy_blight: Aw not teddy :( üêª 
Roper: He was weak
Roper: More of a child whore than a bread winner
Roper: After Vietnam, my dad never was the same üòî
Izzy_blight: He had a rough childhood, his mother was hit by a combine harvester. Not his fault üêª
Izzy_blight: Aw im sorry for the ptsd
Roper: I mean his dark worldview where I got those lines
Izzy_blight: My dads a racist meme 
Roper: In a way, a teddybear is like a whore to the child. They give them comfy till they are discontent and once they go puberty.
Roper: We talk about taht later
Izzy_blight: True
Izzy_blight: I have a cute teady do you want to see him 
Roper: A teddybear is also like weed with addicts. They can't be happy without them. They even make up excuses or haluzinated ghosts just to get that Teddy-drug
Roper: Idc
Izzy_blight: Aw :<
Roper: I mean how you want.
Roper: As long as it isn't sus
Izzy_blight: But...i like the drugs
Roper: Oh taht
Izzy_blight: Oh amogus?
Roper: Your teddy is just a regular teddy, right?
Izzy_blight: Yees
Roper: Aren't you a little too old for teddy?
Izzy_blight: Michael says not
Roper: It's all in your head. The real teddy is your feeling
Izzy_blight: Im a 19 year old woman i can have stuffed animals if i want. Oh. Thats deep
Roper: This beat is just combination of textiles. You just lie to yourself when you think that makes you safer from robbery
Roper: bear*
Roper: Or weird illusion that this Tesdy is somehow sentiment and listens to you instead talking with actual ppl
Izzy_blight: My childhood...
Roper: It's better this way. I didn't choose to lose my innocence, yet I am grateful afterwards
Roper: Being a child means ppl can fool you easier.
Roper: Thats why Dtrump and society are extra careful when it comes about children. Lack of self-control, knowledge and so on.
Roper: Before you go depressed, you are more than just your childhood
Izzy_blight: Im still mentally and emotionally a child. My childhood lasts forever 
Roper: You were a baby, now an adult. Yet the most important thing in your life is that you like iCarly and Henry Danger because they are awsome shows regardless of age. You can enjoy adult and children content without illusions
Roper: Sorry. That's my life lol
Dogday: LankyBox is an exception
Izzy_blight: I need to grow up 
Roper: Idk LankyBox.
Dogday: LankyBox is children content and its absolute garbage
Roper: Bro in my childhood where I from, Internet wasn't a thing
Dogday: Idc what adults watch, as long as it isnt shit like lankybox. If it is, then people have the right to make fun of them until the end of time
Roper: Tbf there's enough shit from both sides. New Jersey Shorts VS CocoMelon
Dogday: in my childhood, minecraft was on mobile and i think it only had survival creative and options
Dogday: idk three buttons on the home screen with a dirt background
Roper: Ppl laughed at me because I still have Minecraft Pocket Edition, yet idc their opinions are temporary 
Roper: Izzy_blight: I need to grow up - Damn those were Izzy's last words
Dogday: she grew up
Roper: Too much that she's almost in grave?
Dogday: no that shes too old for this website
Izzy_blight: Best teddy bear.ignore ugly idiot holding it https://i.postimg.cc/5yvp4V4Q/IMG-20240309-145019.jpg

Roper: Also we can't make an IQ-assessment of this guy, yet if I had a bad day after work and never cut my hairs short, that's me
Izzy_blight: Best teddy. Oh ouch
Roper: I saw this and garfields arrows going left to right in background as giants is stunning. I like the combination of Sans-Garfield-lore with the monster one
Dogday: best song of the week
Dogday: also the little tune at the beginning is one of my favorite parts, idk why
Roper: That too with the atmosphere and graphics around it
Dogday: mhm
Dogday: cant wait to actually play it
Dogday: got a better hard drive on my pc

Dogday: yea
Dogday: it already has some popularity

Roper: As always
Dogday: like angel hare, kinitopet, etc
Dogday: shipwrecked 64 too
Roper: well idk. Not everything has to be fnf-ize
Dogday: ik but it would be kinda cool
Roper: Each music in ultra-field-style would take 2 years
Dogday: well it doesnt have to be perfect like Marios Madness or Sonic.EXE
Roper: A regular song on YouTube when it's just about the music suffices 
Roper: True
Dogday: on another note, i watched mm2
Dogday: and it was as bad as everyone said it was
Prob: Man I‚Äôm bored and horny asf now
Tallguy: mood
Dogday: looks like fucking boss baby back in business, worse than the movie

Dtrump: gay talkers
Neko_yeetus: Twisted love
Lazurus: I might listen to it if I get bored enough
Neko_yeetus: I‚Äôm not far in but it‚Äôs good
Neko_yeetus: They say breasts instead of boobs and it makes the conversations seem so awkward 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I've heard about it, never bothered to read it though. Ik the nap feeling though lmao, that and those three hour naps where you wake up drenched in sweat and upside down are the worst. Omg fr? I can't believe that. Imagine saying "My breasts" instead of "thine threepenny bits"
Neko_yeetus: Lmaooooo
Roper: Bro if Whitetrashfucker would know that you hear an audio book instead reading an actual one then he will make arguments against it
Lazurus: ok I just spit soda on my laptop thank you for that you bonhongaloo
Neko_yeetus: Okay I feel like I‚Äôm weird for this but does anyone else love the feeling where they wake up from a deep sleep bc they are freezing cold and so they cover up again and feel so warm again and you pass out?
Ishipwillowandhunter: You're welcome bb 
Roper: Yes
Dougthediaperguy: i love that feeling
Lazurus: Doug the diaper guy?
Ishipwillowandhunter: You're not the only one. For me the best feeling is waking up in the middle of the night, completely rested and not too warm
Dougthediaperguy: ya what is it
Lazurus: how did you come up with that name
Neko_yeetus: Literally except one time that happened to me in a hotel once and I was sleeping on an air mattress and the blanket was too small so I cried cause I was cold and it was 4 am
Dougthediaperguy: well i sing, i dance. i pee my pants. IM DOUG THE DIAPER GUY
Lazurus: makes sense
Neko_yeetus: Isn‚Äôt that the guy from victorious
Dougthediaperguy: whats that
Dougthediaperguy: oh its a show
Neko_yeetus: Oh maybe not 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Honestly that does not sound like a fun time, AJ. I prefer to wake up in my own bed at 3 am. Oh my god you're right
Roper: The best feeling is when I have the best feeling, guys. World Sadness solved
Ishipwillowandhunter: no it is
Roper: what it is
Neko_yeetus: Ah so many things are happening
Roper: And yet Inunderstand none of them. Twitch reactors be like
Dougthediaperguy: ya what did i walk into
Roper: Nothing meaningful
Neko_yeetus: No you interrupted a very deep conversation
Lazurus: nonsense
Ishipwillowandhunter: Meaning is subjective, human concept. You walked into a bar and said ouch
Dougthediaperguy: thats deep
Roper: Meaning is what lever you wanted to be
Dougthediaperguy: if i was a cat id be a dog
Ishipwillowandhunter: no it was high, that's why you ran into it
Roper: Philosophy is when you can't afford rent from your diploma
Ishipwillowandhunter: I make good jokes
Lazurus: why tf do people comment on porn videos
Neko_yeetus: Funny
Roper: Why not
Lazurus: like just cum and go
Roper: 10/10 would cum again üëå
Lazurus: I'm taking that out of context
Roper: Hwhy would ppl comment on DreamSMP Lets Plays? just cum and go
Neko_yeetus: But you‚Äôve gotta let the girl know you like her bobs
Ishipwillowandhunter: Lmao that's what my bio dad did to my mom. Lazurus: like just cum and go
Neko_yeetus: Oh my god
Lazurus: hey maybe your dad is mine too
Roper: Feedbacks. "Next time, be black"
Neko_yeetus: One time my mom married a sex offender so she could quickly lose custody of me
Dougthediaperguy: oh god
Ishipwillowandhunter: I
Roper: How high was her IQ-score?
Ishipwillowandhunter: what
Lazurus: that sucks
Neko_yeetus: Lmao I think it‚Äôs funny
Roper: Like his mom
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yeah, I'm sorry that's really sucky but how does that work
Dougthediaperguy: clever but wow
Neko_yeetus: Like tf just say you don‚Äôt want custody 
Roper: Wow and clever aren't mutually exclusive states
Neko_yeetus: Instead of getting with a guy that touched a five year old 
Lazurus: she would only lose custody is he touched you while you where under her care
Ishipwillowandhunter: My dad just came in my mom, got drunk and left, came back when I was 3 and kicked me in the mouth and dipped again until I was 9
Dtrump: stfu
Roper: And change and hold your diapers: There's no evidence of god
Dougthediaperguy: no trump
Neko_yeetus: Well technically what happened is my dad found out the guy was there while I was five too and he took her to court 
Roper: I think
Lazurus: well we know what happens when you trust a thought
Roper: I can. Think lol
Dougthediaperguy: what happens when you assume
Dtrump: yes trump
Roper: I agree with what Roper says
Dougthediaperguy: if you hate people just ignore them
Ishipwillowandhunter: Too much is happening i don't know what to respond to or hwo to respond to it
Roper: Same. Idk what I am talking now
Dtrump: ignore yourself
Neko_yeetus: Yea me neither 
Dougthediaperguy: lol loser
Roper: I did your advice before you said it
Dougthediaperguy: ya im going to hit ignore oh his name
Neko_yeetus: I had him ignored on this account alread I think
Dtrump: snowflake
Roper: Type /I Roper and you will get no ads
Ishipwillowandhunter: this is fucked up man
Neko_yeetus: Lol
Ishipwillowandhunter: I say "I'm gay" and nobody bats an eye
Neko_yeetus: IM GAY
Roper: Like my dad when he had sex
Dtrump: imagine getting upset by words
Neko_yeetus: Women are hot
Ishipwillowandhunter: I say "I like hearing pretty boys whimper" and everybody loses their mind
Roper: I like the Proud Boys. They just defend.
Lazurus: I'm just gonna go for my own safety
Dougthediaperguy: you do that
Neko_yeetus: Oh man that‚Äôs good too
Roper: DEFCON 4
Ishipwillowandhunter: Probably best Laz. And agreed AJ, women are hot. I'm pansexual though so I gravitate towards cast irons 
Dtrump: Dougthediaperguy is a kike loving wigger.
Neko_yeetus: Send whimper audio
Neko_yeetus: If you‚Äôre not a minor
Neko_yeetus: I‚Äôm not dream
Roper: Whigger vs whimper lol
Lazurus: real quick if you had to choose one kink for the rest of you life what would it be
Neko_yeetus: Knife
Neko_yeetus: :)
Lazurus: same
Dtrump: I got a two shot kill high score.
Roper: Woman are cold. If she doesn't say yes, it counts as rape even though she doesn't care
Ishipwillowandhunter: say on god
Neko_yeetus: If she‚Äôs not enthusiastic about it it‚Äôs rape 
Dougthediaperguy: i agree
Roper: Neutrality was never an option appearantly 
Lazurus: I'm only gay because I found women easy
Neko_yeetus: ha
Neko_yeetus: You‚Äôre funny
Dtrump: Faggots
Dougthediaperguy: interesting
Neko_yeetus: Oh I‚Äôm pan too
Dougthediaperguy: weird but with my screen name who am i to judge
Roper: If I ask you to get hit and you say "Whatever". then I can if I want
Dtrump: dougthediaperguy implies you have a fetish for children
Ishipwillowandhunter: knife kinks 10/10, though if I had to choose one it'd probably just be domination. Does that count or do I have to be specific? ayy, another pan glazer 
Lazurus: sure? if you elaborate what hit means
Roper: Just say no
Lazurus: trump no one but you has a history with small children
Neko_yeetus: LMAOO
Dougthediaperguy: lol is he still messaging
Neko_yeetus: Mhm
Roper: Yes
Dougthediaperguy: i ignored him
Dougthediaperguy: i wonder if he can still see mine

Neko_yeetus: He‚Äôs been here for a while if he didn‚Äôt stop then he won‚Äôt stop now

18:43 : v
Vegana: Let's say you have an annoying stalker classmate who publishes everything you do in snap. What are you gonna do 

Vegana: D√∂nerbude ist tot
Prob: Anyone on?
Catnap: Im here
Vegana: Oh. Your nice little game didn't worked out, so you came here to search friends after ignoring my question
Vegana: Let's say you have an annoying stalker classmate who publishes everything you do in snap. What are you gonna do 
Vegana: And Catnap? That's from a never-gonna-finished YT cartoon like Digital Circus
Prob: Did you ask me a question? All I saw was E lol
Vegana: If there are Fnf-mods about it, then it has to be popular
Catnap: Damn
Vegana: I didn't saw an E
Prob: Ok
Vegana: Cool. We agree on that AI didn't saw an E :D
Vegana: I*
Prob: Good we agree lol
Vegana: Great. Wonderful. Fantastic. I wonder why this chat does so often
Vegana: dying
Vegana: I am maniac-depressed and noone can help. I don't care.
Vegana: I just have an annoying stalker nerd who follows and reports everything I do. It's like playing Level 52
Vegana: Idc which game, Level 52 is hard in general
Vegana: Name me one game where Level 52 is an easy level
Vegana: Woah. Can you stop giving me attention, guys? I get addicted to it
Vegana: The amount of lurkers reading everything I say. Incredible
Vegana: What am I gonna say next? Ah yes. Cats are cute
Vegana: Now everyone here knows it. Cats are cute
Catnap: Indeed
Vegana: Why is your name Catnap?
Prob: Felt
Catnap: Cuz roleplaying is fun

Vegana: Oh. You actually defended yourself
Prob: Also felt @catnap
Vegana: Cat, Prob felt you
Catnap: Tf dym by felt
Vegana: "Climate always change" yeah but it's one direction, fellow deniers
Vegana: You agreed that cats are cue and Prob felt your emotion towards that agreed opinion
Vegana: cue = cute
Prob: I agree with your sentiment about role play lol 
Vegana: Oh
Catnap: Mk
Vegana: Well, Prob's faukt for being ambiguous 
Vegana: What a nice chat with me as the main character. I wonder what's going to happen next?
Vegana: I am not sleeping. I am dreaming.

Vegana: Signig is against me :( Attack Signig
Vegana: *spells Nigabeans on Signig*
Sannkaed: nobody gives a fyuck
Vegana: I give a fuck. That's enough to get in jail
Izzy_blight: My life is bound and tethered to jimmy
Sannkaed: degenerationals
Vegana: bit sometimes, just sometimes, I don't give a
Sannkaed: jimmy
Sannkaed: smh
Sannkaed: why jimmy
Vegana: Danny
Izzy_blight: Jimmy is a cucklord
Vegana: Izzy is depressed. Help her
Izzy_blight: How did you know 
Vegana: Who's female here 
Prob: Not me
Izzy_blight: My mom
Vegana: Prob, you're obligated to help her. Female X Female
Vegana: Talk about how to manage craps and period
Vegana: idk
Prob: I‚Äôm good I already talk to her a bit but thanks
Vegana: I am so thirsty and yet I have 0.001 liter in my bottle? Infurious
Prob: Darn that sucks
Vegana: Well. Who didn't talked to Izzy?
Vegana: That happens when you have no parents who cares about you: You have to fill your bottle yourself
Izzy_blight: I cried myself to sleep last night for the first time in two years
Vegana: Inpossible, my record was 36 hours
Izzy_blight: Impressive 
Vegana: I know L right, yet I was veeery tired after the 24 hours
Vegana: My bf can do 1 week with ez
Vegana: I was like how? And he says "Night-swift work"
Vegana: like he can train being an vampire
Izzy_blight: My dad is pissed that i keep staying awake for days at a time because im in too much pain to sleep 
Vegana: Dos your dad wear diapers? Because with such a child, he has to piss alot
Derblutgottnageltdichanskreuz: hell
Vegana: That joke didn t make that much sense when your dad has toilet. Still like my joke
Vegana: satan
Vegana: It's a german name NPC who commented and left to an actual game
Vegana: And my lips are spicy after eating peppers
Vegana: I care ;(
Izzy_blight: Hes a grown ass man and im tired of him acting like a child. I mean i act like one too but I have an excuse. I'm severely mentally ill . Hes just a moron
Vegana: Am I a horrible person?
Vegana: This is your opportunity, chat
Izzy_blight: Idk, are you? I don't really know much about you. Probably not 
Vegana: Is it ok to be... horrible sometimes?
Izzy_blight: That's a good question 
Vegana: We're all gonna die in this sinful world. Everything I do is wrong in someone's perspective 
Izzy_blight: Yeah..
Vegana: And in a over-populated world, I will always meet that someone
Izzy_blight: It really is like that, isn't it?
Vegana: Slow but sure death. That's kife
Vegana: life
Vegana: but also my knife
Izzy_blight: Death and taxes and environmental catastrophe
Vegana: If someone bully's me, I deserved it for all the bad things I wasn't punished yet
Vegana: For being impatient, resisting nature and therefore, myself
Vegana: Because I am a part of nature , yet I pretend to be above, even if I am just an animal being easily exposed to drugs
Vegana: Like... who am I?
Izzy_blight: I ask myself the same thing every day 
Vegana: It's all just texts, yet there's more behind the texts
Vegana: There's different ways to end life
Vegana: I choose one of the worse, because noone told me how to get better otherwise. I am glad for the privilege of existing itself. Not many people exists
Vegana: soneine has to be the slave and the master
Vegana: Someone
Vegana: Jesus told us the virtue of suffering. Man, my heads starting to get dizzy and twisting
Vegana: Buddha told us to releax. Mohammad told us to follow commands no matter what.
Izzy_blight: I feel so sick. Everything hurts.C ant think
Vegana: Taoism teaches us that a bad thing can turn out to be good
Vegana: Good luck managing your experiences
Vegana: It's all about being inner silence and focusing on what they tell you
Vegana: Let it go or they let you go, your overwhelming emotions
Vegana: Let it go and they friendly go along with you, because that's what you are, sickness but in a different kind.
Vegana: It doesn't matter what the bullies told you, sickness just is, liek any other objects existing and being.
Vegana: You life because your parents created you. Minimal reasons
Ishipwillowandhunter: fly me to the moon
Vegana: And despite time destroying ourselves right now, there's still the stillness, seemingly timeless
Izzy_blight: The ability to let that which does not matter, truly slide
Izzy_blight: That is what I want 
Vegana: do it
Izzy_blight: If it was that easy, I definitely would 
Izzy_blight: I would have done it a long time ago 
Vegana: Just. Do it. Noone else will do it for you. You have to try to become You
Vegana: A You that you accept
Ishipwillowandhunter: what did I get on to
Izzy_blight: Who the fuck is me? Idk
Ishipwillowandhunter: what...
Izzy_blight: Oh, it's you. Hello.
Vegana: Be aware of awareness and you know, you're an empty vessel and everything around you tries to fill you
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yes, it's me. That sounded oddly hostile 
Vegana: Think about it: when was the last time You choose to believe in anything? Did you asked for your birth? Religion? Ideology?
Izzy_blight: That's because it is 
Izzy_blight: I don't know
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm on briefly so tell me what you want, please
Vegana: It's how it is. The only hostile thought is thinking that you're obligated to be something more than what you already are
Izzy_blight: I got nothing to say to you 
Izzy_blight: Well actually I do but we can save it for later 
Vegana: I want to end suffering, but I can't, so I dance with it. During that process, I learned that most things I fought for, was from indoctrination and force of habit. All the money will be gone when I die
Izzy_blight: Philosophy is fun
Vegana: The past and the future is a fever dream, but there's the presence , there's this now and that's what you are. You are now, the past and the present is Hait your memory construction you do it now and can be formable
Izzy_blight: I am everything and nothing and all of it is terrible 
Vegana: Ignore that "Hait" like my entire speech if you want too
Vegana: That's something. Now my pain stops from itself
Vegana: But th pain will come back, that's my expectation
Izzy_blight: I don't even know what were talking about anymore. Im blinded by rage
Vegana: Ok so taking it easier: how many useless things did you invest
Vegana: Or brought
Izzy_blight: All of the m. Every last one 
Vegana: And was that really You buying these things? A different you? External influence
Izzy_blight: I'm a different me every 5 minutes
Izzy_blight: Emotional liability
Vegana: It is sometimes the smallest moments that makes one suffering person happy
Vegana: What is the most consistent trait about you, if you have one? You don't have to be consistent. Logic is just a tool created by humans.
Vegana: The most constant I mean
Izzy_blight: I don't know 
Vegana: What is it, that the 5-year-old Izzy, the 6-year-old Izzy and all the Izzys all the time meanwhile reflecting on if you want to now, agree on
Izzy_blight: I'm empathetic i guess. Extremely. Which makes it feel worse when I go crazy and do horrible things 
Izzy_blight: Which i do a lot 
Vegana: Ever consider doing social work?
Izzy_blight: I have. At some point 
Vegana: What happened? Or are you on the way
Izzy_blight: I've considered a lot of things 
Vegana: Oh.
Izzy_blight: I don't know. I'm on the road to nowhere 
Vegana: Well, maybe you should also try before time passes to enact on even one of your best consideration
Vegana: You said you're empathic and we agree that we will die on age 80, so what are you expecting in this world
Vegana: Happy death where you at least did anything like helping eldery VS the Izzy who's still the same depressed maybe-unemployed as now in anon chat
Vegana: But then again, idk you
Izzy_blight: I'm gonna right what i can. Then I'm gonna shove off. I'm not living anywhere near 80. Maybe 30.
Vegana: Thats sad. I hope the doctors can fix yor health problems and you improving yourself aswell
Izzy_blight: I hope so too
Izzy_blight: I think. I don't know. What I want 
Vegana: "After comparing the proportion of those who died at a younger age to those who died at an older age, the researcher concluded that longevity only began to significantly increase‚Äîpast the age of 30 or so‚Äîabout 30,000 years ago." - https://www.verywellhealth.com/longevity-throughout-history-2224054
SHOW IMAGE
Vegana: Sorry. Thought it would be ineresting to compare
Izzy_blight: Wow. Damn. Actually that is interesting 
Vegana: So yeah you actually are as healthy as a caveman, not below I guess
Izzy_blight: Hey that actually got my mind off everything else for the first time today. I like learning facts. Ooga booga im cave dweller
Vegana: If this would be my school, someone would point out that nutrition and bone density and muscles count as health too but you know over-simplified 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Is this how I sound half the time? With my philosophy bs? Also, I'll not be on much today. So you'll have to wait to verbally punish me until later tonight most likely
Vegana: It's ok, we all have our phases
Izzy_blight: Lovely 
Vegana: Cavemans were natural artists too
Toxicego357: Balls
Vegana: Vegana
Toxicego357: Cavemen*
Ishipwillowandhunter: Uh, if anyone gets on tell them I'll be on tonight as usual? I don't know. Sorry for everything but also I'm not really. Love you, please stop hating me for only something you perceive as wrong
Vegana: Cavewomen
Izzy_blight: Cave painting üñºÔ∏è 
Toxicego357: Take care mich
Izzy_blight: Fuck you
Vegana: Taht escalated quickly 
Izzy_blight: I'm glad you're still a dick so i can still be mad
Vegana: Sus quote
Izzy_blight: I hope I stay mad all day just for you you piece of shit
Izzy_blight: Mmmm. Fuck
Vegana: Well I got nothing to tell except "Choose random instead dwelling into your thoughts" Someone will be proud of you getting a job and you earn money.
Izzy_blight: I know this isn't right. This isnt me
Vegana: We all have our demons
Izzy_blight: I have all of hell caged in my skull
Vegana: With cavemen paintings?
Izzy_blight: With rusty bars that snap  liket wigs
Vegana: Wierd idea: You seem to be like a person who needs a doctor, right? Become your own doctor
Vegana: Study medicine and you can put yourself as study subject, test and analyze yourself and hence fixing yourself
Izzy_blight: Im too squeamish for medicine 
Vegana: Your orientation is to end suffer, become your own solution instead expecting from someone else
Izzy_blight: Thats the antithesis of everything i am
Vegana: How about psychotherapist and you can therapy yourself them
Izzy_blight: I don't think that's how it works 
Vegana: Anti-thesis is just another thesis
Izzy_blight: Thesis statement of 
Vegana: You learn other ppl who may have same mental problems as you, except they solved it
Izzy_blight: Ohghji im so angry
Vegana: Do you know why? No? Investigate yourself
Izzy_blight: I do
Vegana: Like study some field instead doing Google, if you're ready to officially fail ofc
Vegana: A field where it can also fix you
Vegana: Maybe a sympathetic Psychology University Professor can teach and help you with your problems aswell
Izzy_blight: I dont want to get over it. I wanna rip the stars to shreds i dont want to feel better
Vegana: Well... Do math then. All kids feel worse afterwards
Vegana: Or become a Quantity-over-quality fake YouTuber
Izzy_blight: God no, id rather die. I hate these guys
Vegana: You don't want to feel better but also not worse?
Vegana: You just want to feel neutral?
Izzy_blight: I want to feel nothing at all 
Izzy_blight: Im tired of feeling 
Vegana: Nothing in particular or numb?
Izzy_blight: I don't know. Just nothing. Nothing that can cause problems 
Vegana: Ncbi discovered that neutral affect does exist. A perosn can feel strongly neutral. Let me think
Vegana: So if you're dead, you have no emotions, but you want to live
Izzy_blight: Not particularly 
Vegana: They tested affect/emotions by exhausting patients with cognitive tests
Vegana: The more they did exhausting things, the less they felt neutral and more to no emotion I guess. They never defined the state beyond neutral, less than neutral
Vegana: But by being exhausting, they experience less, so the max without dying would be borderline death?
Vegana: or like almost being "shutdown"
Vegana: Heres the stick, if you feel nothing, you feel something, mainly nothing in particular or boredom
Vegana: It's about not feeling
Vegana: A state beyond nothing and everything might be letting other ppl controlling you
Vegana: Between all and none, there's one. But a non-arbitrary, from your senses immediate one. The puppet master
Izzy_blight: Imtired. My brain is flatliining. Kinda feels good 
Vegana: Once you just follow commands and ignore your feelings like numb, then there might be that a person has no emotions, not even neutral at all. But this was never proven and is just thought experiment 
Izzy_blight: I follow the commands of my feelings and little else
Vegana: Other scientists are saying that emotions and affect are responses to environment, so the only way to have no emotions at all is by not responding at all
Vegana: Drugs
Izzy_blight: My emotions control me and my life
Todd_clorox: Cocaine controls me and my life.
Izzy_blight: w
Izzy_blight: Based and redpilled
Vegana: But like "coma-drugs" . Something which disables all psychological responses if that exists
Izzy_blight: Gimme some 
Vegana: Idk I never thought of having no emotions at all like what's wrong with emotions?
Vegana: The feeling of inner peace is a drug our body produces legally
Todd_clorox: I prefer cocaine over inner peace.
Vegana: Yet sadly, it is a feeling so rejected in Izzy's mental world. Even though she can achieve inner silence though nothing in brain, is this really peace when there are no one. Even if, she wouldn't notice
Vegana: Noticing itself leads to emotions, even feeling neutrally or unsure
Izzy_blight: Everything is so loud.my brain screams 
Vegana: Take the pills or investigate and try alternate solutions
Vegana: Isn't Cocaine like you always winning wars
Izzy_blight: I dont know if i want to get better. I definitely do but. I don't know 
Vegana: Do you want to know through?
Izzy_blight: I don't know what I want 
Izzy_blight: Everything is so confusing 
Vegana: You don't want to remove confusion or you don't knowI?
Todd_clorox: I just want a big ol' booty to eat.
Vegana: Pretend that you're part of this community and pretend that you know then?
Vegana: Like a substitute provisional solution
Izzy_blight: Everything is so. So. Mnhgbvfghmmjui. There are reasons that people with my condition have a higher suicide rate
Vegana: Idk your list of conditions
Vegana: as I said, doctor
Vegana: You're too confused to even know if you want to feel better
Izzy_blight: Jimmys a doctor 
Izzy_blight: Yes
Vegana: Look: Do you prefer positive emotions or neutral ones?
Todd_clorox: I wish I was a doctor so I could get free drugs.
Vegana: You said you want to feel no emotions, yet do you even thought what it means
Vegana: Why rejecting the positive
Izzy_blight: I want to be happy. I just want to get everything i want or nothing at all 
Vegana: its like a guy rejecting $ 100
Vegana: See. That's the orientation
Vegana: now what's the best way to solve your mental and biological problems to get happyness?
Vegana: It starts with D and ends with a R
Izzy_blight: i get it. Don't patronize me please 
Vegana: Natural Science Superiority T-pose
Dredfurst: What the Lightning McFuck is happening
Vegana: Ok you have the right to do alternative ways such as summon soirits
Vegana: spirits *
Vegana: Lightning McQueen, but he's neither lightning at night, from McDonalds nor a any royal title wearing at all
Vegana: I healed chat. I am.
Vegana: Let's forgive each other, because this is all what left, us people with flaws, this generation. If we revenge, things starting to get worse
Izzy_blight: The best revenge is none at all 
Vegana: What if you're the victim
Dredfurst: It's just one of those days where you don't want to wake up
Everything is fucked, everybody sucks
You don't really know why but you want to justify
Rippin' someone's head off
No human contact
And if you interact, your life is on contract
Your best bet is to stay away motherfucker
It's just one of those days
Izzy_blight: It is on e of those days 
Izzy_blight: Idk i know im not the victim 
Vegana: I tried . I almsot got into a fight because he disrespect me as a "hacker"
Vegana: Because he made a joke about me. Big mistake at bad Mondays
Vegana: Btw he wanted the fight. I just smiled by accidnet
Izzy_blight: Another shitty day. I'm horny
Vegana: It's better than death
Vegana: It's so easy to be stupid, yet it's hard to be smart
Vegana: You can't forgive everything, but you can move
Izzy_blight: I think i am setting down roots
Vegana: In a world full of sacristy and self-interested conflict, expecting people to get along is too naive. So let's just pretend we like each other
Todd_clorox: I think I'm dying.
Vegana: Resource scareness
Vegana: Scarcity and other mistakes I made not just in grammar
Vegana: Pretend, that we like the likes itself
Vegana: Not pretending to liek eachother but the likes ... itself *closes eyes*
Todd_clorox: Can I get your dealer's number?
Vegana: $ 80
Todd_clorox: Best I can do is $3.50
Vegana: Being myself is the hardest psychedelic drug 
Vegana: There's no grandma's secret
Vegana: recipe
Todd_clorox: What about grandpa's secret
Todd_clorox: recipe
Vegana: Your mom
Vegana: There's no drug
Todd_clorox: My dad
Vegana: You can be that too if you try and get deprived
Vegana: and depressed, and maniac, and scared
Vegana: I did so many sad things *snob*
Vegana: *sobers*
Vegana: Yop. This is the time I should shut up.
Vegana: Can't use English anymore

Raul_menendez: better question wth is anxiety?
Raul_menendez: never had it befor
Vulpix_axel: ...
Raul_menendez: lol I'm going back to dark
Izzy_blight: Jealousy is that thing you feel when Jimmy has more toy cars than you. Anxiety is what you feel when Jimmy is outside your window 
Raul_menendez: lmao
Raul_menendez: no clue who Jimmy is so I can't relate at all
Izzy_blight: You'll know soon
Izzy_blight: 7 days.
Raul_menendez: if he shows up he is as good as dead
Izzy_blight: Jimmy is invincible, he can't be vinced
Izzy_blight: Vince is Jimmy's enemy.  Nice guy but very ineffective
Izzy_blight: As soon as Michael leaves everyone goes quiet. Ouch
Djshrimpdick: Become Bee Cum
Neko_yeetus: Sorry I‚Äôm trying to play a game

Izzy_blight: Buggy masterpiece
Neko_yeetus: I‚Äôll be back later Izzy I‚Äôm going to join a party with my friends so I‚Äôll talk to you soon love
Raul_menendez: cyberpunk kinda W game but terrible at luanch
Izzy_blight: See you later, have fun 
Izzy_blight: ‚ù§
Izzy_blight: Yeah that sounds about right 
Raul_menendez: I miss having chats like that with seannah ü•≤
Izzy_blight: I miss being able to have chats with anyone without the constant fear of having an emotional meltdown
Raul_menendez: even me?
Izzy_blight: Depending on what you say yes
Raul_menendez: I don't feel like you would have any type of emotional connection with me to cause you to have an emotional meltdown
Izzy_blight: Maybe not, but...ah it's complicated 
Raul_menendez: so life?
Rain69: sucks
Raul_menendez: bingo
Izzy_blight: Life went downhill fast after i hit 16
Raul_menendez: not here
Raul_menendez: im 16 
Izzy_blight: Ah children 
Raul_menendez: nah kidding 15 1/2
Izzy_blight: Wow oof
Raul_menendez: my parents want to put me in drivers ed
Izzy_blight: Im 2
Raul_menendez: and apparently I'm on some type of driving insurance plan
Raul_menendez: no clue what that is
Izzy_blight: I'm just gonna get a bicycle
Raul_menendez: I want a 1995 Ford truck preferably a v8 or 10
Izzy_blight: I'm a big environmentally conscious freak and I don't trust myself to operate a vehicle 
Izzy_blight: I would definitely commit property damage or manslaughters 
Izzy_blight: Or both 
Izzy_blight: Probably both
Raul_menendez: or
Raul_menendez: most likely none
Raul_menendez: its your own will
Raul_menendez: your choice to  run people over seems pretty far fetched]
Izzy_blight: My will is not my own
Izzy_blight: I am not free
Izzy_blight: Invisible chains bind me
Raul_menendez: but it is your will even if you aren't free you still have the will to make your own decisions
Izzy_blight: No, not really. My emotions make the decisions. I have no self control 
Raul_menendez: then get some work on it as hard as you can I dob't have self control myself
Izzy_blight: I need therapy for my BPD and other issues but i don't want therapy 
Raul_menendez: I have ad-hd and anger issues I should know a thing or two about letting my emotions take the wheel
Raul_menendez: If you need it bad you should probably do it
Izzy_blight: I should but i dont feel like I'm ready or like I deserve it 
Raul_menendez: deserve it?!? If you need it you need it there is no deserving or not in this situation!
Izzy_blight: I deserve to be tortured like this forever 
Izzy_blight: I'm a bad person 
Raul_menendez: no matter how bad you mess up someone somewhere anywhere should at least hold there hand out for you to help you out of your hole your prison
Raul_menendez: no matter even the baddest people will have there chance a redemption
Izzy_blight: It would be better for everyone for me to get help but my insecurities and laziness and monstrous self image hold me back 
Raul_menendez: would you take that chance?
Izzy_blight: I don't know. Part of me wants to believe im a lost cause and it's not worth it 
Raul_menendez: then you should feel ashamed for that because you are a precious being who deserves a lot more then you get
Raul_menendez: you deserve to get all the help you need
Izzy_blight: I feel ashamed for a lot of reasons. Yeah things would be better if I stopped trying to destroy myself all the time but it's all I want to do 
Raul_menendez: I wish I knew you better to help you out when you feel like shit but i'm not I do enjoy seeing the people on this site I see as friends happy. you are one of them and seeing you like thee way you are doesn't feel right to me.
Raul_menendez: I want to help so much but there is very little I can do for you sadly
Izzy_blight: I've made a lot of mistakes and I suffer for them every day. Everything is how it should be. It's all good. Sorry
Raul_menendez: but beating yourself down isn't the answer for any of your problems you should build yourself up into something you wouldn't every imagine yourself being the day before
Raul_menendez: its better to be proud then ashamed of yourself
Izzy_blight: I don't know who I am or what I'm supposed to be. I'm lost
Izzy_blight: I guess we all are in some way 
Raul_menendez: then find who you are in the abyss your lost in find the light that will guide you
Raul_menendez: ....you so have a point there
Raul_menendez: do*
Raul_menendez: at least
Izzy_blight: Well it's more a symptom of my BPD, it's called identity confusion. I'm not sure what I can do about it. I have a pointy stick üç¢ 
Raul_menendez: hehe
Ishipwillowandhunter: be on very shortly
Raul_menendez: ...tbh I didn't know what bpd was and I just looked it up and... sorry it must be hard for you. Do you see me as a friend?
Izzy_blight: It's... very, very difficult. Thank you. I don't really feel like I have friends. I'm scared to make them because I always lose them
Izzy_blight: Due to my own faults
Raul_menendez: well I promise you won't ever lose me as a friend
(anon): aww
Izzy_blight: Awww indeed
Izzy_blight: Thank you 
Izzy_blight: Good  fellow
Raul_menendez: what is the point in hurting others?
Izzy_blight: To gain control 
Rain69: too see the pain in their eyes
Raul_menendez: control over what tho?
Raul_menendez: there is no true gain in hurting others
Izzy_blight: I need to control them and make them stay so they love me and don't leave me 
Izzy_blight: It doesn't work like that though, obviously 
Izzy_blight: But my brain doesn't know that 
Raul_menendez: control, greed, jealousy, lust, and so many more reasons to hurt someone, but what good will it do tho?
Raul_menendez: maybe it'll feel good to let some anger out
Raul_menendez: but
Raul_menendez: will it feel like that afterward?
Izzy_blight: Yeah... it's never worth it.
Izzy_blight: ever
Raul_menendez: or would you feel guilt? surrow? sorry for the person? 
Izzy_blight: All of those 
Izzy_blight: I feel so ugly and stupid and mean
Raul_menendez: but you aren't
Izzy_blight: I am. Or at least the worm in my head is. it makes me 
Izzy_blight: I'm starting to tear up
Izzy_blight: I don't know why 
Raul_menendez: who knows you might be as beautiful as a field of dandelions on a warm spring day
Raul_menendez: there will always be good everywhere you just need to know where to look
Izzy_blight: That does sound lovely. Physically and mentally though I'm more like an abandoned slaughterhouse. Yeah. I've looked in all the wrong places
Raul_menendez: so?
Raul_menendez: so have I 
Raul_menendez: am I a monster then?
Izzy_blight: No. I am 
Izzy_blight: I'm the thing that hides under your bed 
Raul_menendez: if I'm not a monster then you shouldn't be one either
Izzy_blight: I think I am therefore I am
Raul_menendez: the should I come down a say hi? give you some ccmpany
Izzy_blight: I'd. I'd like that 
Izzy_blight: I'm tearing up again why
Raul_menendez: I hope the tears that are coming out aren't ones of sadness but something else that is warmer but not to warm
Izzy_blight: They are something not sad. Im not sure what 
Lazurus: bck
Raul_menendez: I truly hope you can find your lost pieces that you lost years ago and piece back together to make a magnificent and stunning return to your usual self being no longer lost and at peace with yourself
Raul_menendez: wb
Lazurus: dang what did I miss
Izzy_blight: I do love villain redemption stories, they're some of my favorites
Izzy_blight: But the ones where they die at the end are also satisfying
Lazurus: true although I like it when the villain actually shows they care about the mc
Raul_menendez: I hope the best for you izzy
Izzy_blight: My MC betrayed me many years ago
Izzy_blight: Thank you, I hope I die
Izzy_blight: Die happy i mean 
Izzy_blight: Sorry 
Lazurus: your fine just try not to be so depresso drink sum coffee
Raul_menendez: die a very long and fulfilled happy life
Izzy_blight: Coffee is a drug i don't like drugs
Izzy_blight: And it makes me pee
Ishipwillowandhunter: Coffee makes me sleepy. I want it
Raul_menendez: my metabolism is to fast so I don't truly get the effect of the coffee
Ishipwillowandhunter: I miss being my bsfs favorite 
Izzy_blight: Me too.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Nevermind. She still likes me but since she has him she's trying to distance a little. Still hurts but eh
Izzy_blight: I just realized that means I'm not your best friend. Normally I would be upset about that 
Izzy_blight: but fuck you.
Ishipwillowandhunter: See and this is why you're not 
Izzy_blight: Yeah I think we're done 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't really like putting titles like bsf but sometimes you just feel it, yk? 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Lmao sweetheart there was never anything to finish 
Izzy_blight: I'm so sick of you. You fucking lizard
Ishipwillowandhunter: Me? That's rich
Izzy_blight: Good. It was all a lie huh? So I don't have to feel bad. Don't sweetheart me you snake
Raul_menendez: ...
Izzy_blight: I'm learning a lot this month. A lot
Raul_menendez: like?
Izzy_blight: I don't necessarily like any of it 
Ishipwillowandhunter: You caused this. I did like you at onepoint. You're doing this and you just keep continuing it. I've done nothing wrong. I've just not kept your delusions in check and I have tended to your every need cuz I'm not a goddamn nurse
Izzy_blight: I'm mentally ill, you are too, go to hell, I love you
Raul_menendez: its kinda hard to tell if you are mad at each other or not lol
Izzy_blight: Oh definitely 
Izzy_blight: I have never hated this son of a bitch like i do today 
Ishipwillowandhunter: No you don't. I can't honestly say I love you. But you're here so that's nice. Yes but mine allow me to be at least somewhat stable 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Sorry princess 
Izzy_blight: If you don't love me then why have you kept saying it, and kept me for this long? For pity? For yourself?
Izzy_blight: I doubt you pity me. Heartless bastard. I understand why though
Raul_menendez: or maybe because she sees you as a friend but you let your emotions take control and yell at mich like she is the bad guys
Raul_menendez: bad guy*
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't want to be honest right now. I'm not so heartless. Or maybe its the fact I don't want what I say to be seen by eyes other than yours. I do in fact pity you
Raul_menendez: also is mich he or she lmao
Izzy_blight: Everything I fucking thought about you was wrong
Izzy_blight: I thought we was family 
Raul_menendez: family can become distant but you never truly fall apart
Ishipwillowandhunter: Sorry donny, we isn't nothing you thought we was
Whitetrashfucker: Hello
Whitetrashfucker: I am white trash fucker 
Ishipwillowandhunter: You acting like this just irritates me. In reality I have done very little. You have done this. You lied to yourself
Whitetrashfucker: Whoa drama

Raul_menendez: Izzy mich does have a point there
Raul_menendez: calm down
Whitetrashfucker: No don‚Äôt calm down don‚Äôt let them tell you what to do 
Whitetrashfucker: Lose your shit
Raul_menendez: your letting your emotions tell you things that aren't real your confusing people who want to help you with people who don't
Izzy_blight: You just destroyed our relationship, right here, right now. You got AJ eating out of the palm of your fucking hand within two days. You've robbed me of the only two things that I care about 
Dtrump: idc
Whitetrashfucker: Yes!

Raul_menendez: lol good one trump
Whitetrashfucker: Oh maybe I spread my seed a lot in my younger days 
Lazurus: dad?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Excuse me?
Izzy_blight: Telling me to calm down and be rational is like asking me to not breathe
Whitetrashfucker: Look I‚Äôll cut to the chase: your mother is a bitch 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Me and AJ aren't that close. She's cool. I like her. But we aren't like that. And there was nothing to wreck other than the wall of delusion you built up inside your head
Lazurus: wait a minute where were you on November 21 2005
Dtrump: your going to  get brain bleeds
Raul_menendez: sorry but your getting to worked up
Izzy_blight: Or telling a forest fire to stop burning

Dtrump: love triangle
Whitetrashfucker: I owed a bunch for taxes and I knocked up like a half dozen hoes 
Raul_menendez: just...ughh I don't know anymore\
Izzy_blight: Stop getting mad at me for being severely mentally ill and unable to be rational 
Whitetrashfucker: Just moved to a country with no extradition treaties 
Lazurus: well thanks for the 7 inches of penis father
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh, I'm not mad. I'm quite calm and I find your anger misplaced, childish, slightly funny if anything
Izzy_blight: You are such an infuriating little shape-shifting prick
Izzy_blight: Who the fuck are you
Dtrump: It's been a month of you two fighting daily.
Whitetrashfucker: 7 inches there we go definitely my progeny 
Izzy_blight: You are not my son 
Whitetrashfucker: Mine is 7 inches around 
Izzy_blight: Well there goes the old ball game. I don't know how to process this right now but I will and it will not feel good 
Lazurus: I got the oppisite end of that I got it 7 inches long 4 inches wide
Ishipwillowandhunter: My reactions are entirely dependent on your own. I was never your son. You had an idea of me that you considered your son, maybe. As soon as I'm out of that mold, you freak out.
Whitetrashfucker: I hollow bitches out 
Whitetrashfucker: Used to anyways not so much now 
Lazurus: I like getting hollowed out ig I'm the opposite
Izzy_blight: I'm going to bed. Thanks for everything Michael. I must say,  your mind picked the worst possible time to go rogue

Ishipwillowandhunter: I am somewhat of an attention whore, as well as a regular whore so maybe
Neko_yeetus: I like being called a whore :)

Roper: Oh I get it. You did philosophy bs just because you wanted roleplay
Neko_yeetus: I will never erp again I just realized
Ishipwillowandhunter: How is roleplay at all related to philosophy? I'm talking about the intricacies of life my mans
Neko_yeetus: Cause a fool has taken my heart
Ishipwillowandhunter: Same. It's boring. why though?
Neko_yeetus: What a bitch 
Roper: You couldn't stand Whitetrashfucker talking about something which isn't horny
Ishipwillowandhunter: No, I don't mind. The fact he wasn't horny just made me more determined, I like turning people on
Neko_yeetus: I wonder if he‚Äôs awake
Roper: You mentioned before like "Is this what I sound like when I do philosophy bs"
Ishipwillowandhunter: It's almost sundress season boys
Roper: So it's a tactic you're aware of. Ok so you just find Whitetrashfucker boring

Ishipwillowandhunter: Why is it the most important?

Ishipwillowandhunter: No blame is mine 
Izzy_blight: I thought we had something
Izzy_blight: And you turned around and hold me all of it was a lie

Izzy_blight: You don't have to tell me
Izzy_blight: I just do what I do anyway and whatever you say to me won't fucking matter
Ishipwillowandhunter: And stop acting like this is purely the result of whatever mental illness you have. Considering your previous feelings for her and everything leading up to niw, you would've been upset and jealous anyways
Izzy_blight: Yep and you you knew that
Izzy_blight: And yet you still
Ishipwillowandhunter: Your mental illnesses just give you a somewhat logical way to be an asshole

Izzy_blight: And this is what I get
Ishipwillowandhunter: No, no it isn't 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm not trying g to hurt you
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm just not conforming to your specific needs

Ishipwillowandhunter: We were until a few days ago
Ishipwillowandhunter: In order for you to not be like this
Izzy_blight: Yeah when you decidedto start this
Ishipwillowandhunter: I would've had to be completely silent while AJ was here
Izzy_blight: You did something that you knew I wouldn't be able to forgive you for
Ishipwillowandhunter: And I really don't want to do that
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh, oh

Jeffreymoro: Ok. What would be for the boss-convincing reasons to being gone from workplace?
Jeffreymoro: Well, I am surprised that the chat did took my concerns seriously at all. Thanks for saying that I did messed up.
Jeffreymoro: Better toilet breaks than sick leave like my other co-workers, just sayin
Toxicego357: gtg
Jeffreymoro: Sannkaed, I believe in more humane bosses, who accepts being 5 mins late because one man can't control the entire traffic
Sannkaed: what job do you hold
Rain69: hey
Jeffreymoro: Also I saw a lot of other ppl chilling in toilet too, so why only focusing on me
Jeffreymoro: Garden helper if that's what it's called
Jeffreymoro: I remove undesirable plants all day, yet I can also build furnitures, since this company is connected with other branches
Jeffreymoro: And yes, removing wild plants is boring and mind-numbing. 
Jeffreymoro: I say that I vomitted in toilet. That way, I reduce the L coming?

Izzy_blight: Apparently not at all
Roper: Does it matter if they care? Why do you care about caring so much?

Izzy_blight: Because I have borderline and I need to be cared about
Izzy_blight: Or I get very very very very very very very very upset

Ishipwillowandhunter: Does the 1% matter at all? Tonight was going good and maybe I could've continued the good feelings but as soon as I acted out, all that would've been thrown away
Izzy_blight: I am very unhappy
Roper: Does being good matters? Just be.
Izzy_blight: I just wanted one good conversation
Roper: Describe it
Izzy_blight: I wanted to share some good news and say some things I wanted to say and then I was going to take some time off
Ishipwillowandhunter: izzy you were upset pretty much the moment I got here and it wasn't even my fault
Izzy_blight: I just wanted a good send off and I didn't get to have that
Izzy_blight: Yes
Izzy_blight: It was my fault for getting my hopes up I should have known better
Roper: You can still share good vibes and say whatever you want to say with concequences 
Izzy_blight: I was blinded by my excitement and optimism
Izzy_blight: This is why I'm a pessimist
Roper: That was yor optimistic Izzy?
Izzy_blight: I actually was feeling very optimistic all day
Izzy_blight: I was I was actually happy all day I was happy and I wanted to come here and be happy with everyone else
Roper: I don't wanna know her pessimistic side
Izzy_blight: I have 50 sides and all of them are awful and aren't worth knowing
Ishipwillowandhunter: Your happiness brings us happiness but our happiness means your suffering 
Izzy_blight: Yep
Roper: What if you get into a relationship? Your bf/gf will give you all the attention and affection you want
Izzy_blight: I don't really have anything to add to what you just said it's really unfortunate
Izzy_blight: No one could ever love me
Izzy_blight: I'm afraid that's out of the question
Roper: But you wanted too and it's maybe too late to change your parents so get married?
Izzy_blight: Even if I found love what would I do with it
Izzy_blight: I would just ruin it like I always have
Ishipwillowandhunter: You found love
Ishipwillowandhunter: You have been loved
Izzy_blight: And I fucked it up
Ishipwillowandhunter: ugh
Izzy_blight: I have proven myself unworthy of it
Izzy_blight: Yes ugh
Roper: You ruin yourself and your husband will understand it
Izzy_blight: I am infuriating I know
Izzy_blight: I am infuriated and frustrated by me as well
Izzy_blight: My husband's name is Jonathan Jingleheimer
Izzy_blight: What the fuck it actually
Roper: Maybe all you needed is a true friend. Not romance
Izzy_blight: I said jingleheimer and the speech to text actually got it
Izzy_blight: I have a true friend
Izzy_blight: or I had
Izzy_blight: I don't even really know anymore
Izzy_blight: I think I fucked it up
Izzy_blight: Just like I always do
Roper: Search another one 
Izzy_blight: I was born to be alone
Izzy_blight: I don't want another one
Roper: Become your own friend
Izzy_blight: I'm my own worst enemy
Izzy_blight: And it's going to stay that way for a long time
Roper: One of your inner voices can be your friend
Izzy_blight: Because I'm too fucking stupid to do what I have to
Rogue: finally some truth
Izzy_blight: I have one inner voice that likes meBut it's very quiet
Roper: Maybe there's not much to say
Izzy_blight: Sometimes it it makes me question why I do this to myself
Roper: It raises a lot of questions 
Izzy_blight: The universe is full of questions
Izzy_blight: one being who the actual heckputs milk before cereal
Roper: You have to accept help and questions aswell. If not, that inner voice will be afraid to speak up
Izzy_blight: Who does that Are you a cereal killer
Roper: I am a cereal noticer of accidents
Izzy_blight: I'm not good at accepting things
Izzy_blight: or speaking up
Izzy_blight: I am a cereal box full of jimmies
Izzy_blight: Okay I actually feel calmer than I have in the last
Izzy_blight: How long is it been Let me check what time it is
Roper: Nah your inner voice. They know that you're a closed person. To be helped, you have to let your toxicity go
Izzy_blight: It's 1:00 a.m. already holy fuck
Izzy_blight: My toxicity is part of me
Roper: You have insomnia 
Izzy_blight: Everything is a copy of a copy of a copy
Roper: I guess you need an enemy
Izzy_blight: You're never really asleep and you're never really awake
Izzy_blight: I have an enemy.me
Roper: I am not sleeping, I am dreaming
Izzy_blight: I still feel like I might be too. I'm sorry tempted to pinch myself again
Roper: The only way to be for yourself is to be against yourself 
Izzy_blight: Oh yes so that makes sense
Izzy_blight: Actually
Izzy_blight: It kind of makes senseNow that I think about it
Roper: You have to destroy the bad parts to become the good person
Izzy_blight: ExactlyBut I can't do that
Izzy_blight: I need help
Roper: Professonal help
Izzy_blight: But I can't and won't get it
Izzy_blight: At least not for a while
Roper: Why
Izzy_blight: personal reasons
Roper: Then you need to personally solve this, not chat
Izzy_blight: I don't know how
Roper: Rip
Izzy_blight: I'm not so good on my own
Roper: Ask outside help
Izzy_blight: I am unable to can
Roper: Ask your inside help
Izzy_blight: I feel like I have to handle everything on my own
Roper: Same
Izzy_blight: But I'm not strong enough
Roper: Try it
Izzy_blight: I am weak and I am broken
Izzy_blight: I have
Izzy_blight: many many many times
Roper: And? You can still move. Try different
Izzy_blight: Yes I suppose John Cena was right. Naver give up
Izzy_blight: I wish I was John Cena He's so cool
Roper: Why should you even?
Izzy_blight: I wish I was cool
Izzy_blight: Because of Jimmy
Izzy_blight: God I need
Roper: Is this what Jimmy would want it
Izzy_blight: I'm losing everything to this fucking borderline
Roper: Talk to yourself, not me
Izzy_blight: I'm losing the only two people I care about enough to torture myself like this for
Izzy_blight: And I have no one to blame but me
Izzy_blight: I am talking to myself right now
Roper: Blame doesn't matter. It's what you do next
Izzy_blight: But I liketo feel heard
Izzy_blight: What I do next will undoubtedly be more of the same
Roper: But you're too afraid to scream in your apartment. How does your dad know when you need help?
Izzy_blight: My dad
Izzy_blight: When I need help my dad gets angry at me
Izzy_blight: I had a panic attack in the hallway the other night and he screamed and swore at me and told me to go to bed
Izzy_blight: I've told him I have borderline and he doesn't care
Roper: The person he supposed to care about you. Well I would be angry aswell when I see my child wracking themself and messing up their life beyond repair
Izzy_blight: Nobody cares
Izzy_blight: Well being angry at me is not the way you fix me
Izzy_blight: I can certainly tell you that much
Roper: Look. There are the options. You can choose to but you refuse
Izzy_blight: I'm not in the mood argue anymore
Roper: Being angry is a respond of him being desperate and not knowing without his mom what he's gonna fix you
Izzy_blight: I am full of shame and I have such a headache
Roper: I mean your mom = his wife
Izzy_blight: They weren't married
Izzy_blight: She was just a whore
Roper: Well, two parent is better than one
Izzy_blight: Just like me
Izzy_blight: It certainly is
Roper: And that's maybe why she's qualified to be your mom with same genes and life experience 
Izzy_blight: Like mother likedaughter
Izzy_blight: She would be so proud to know that her little girl is a raging fucking maniac and a slut
Roper: You would be surprised how much kids copy their parents without noticing it
Izzy_blight: It's a shame I got two shitty parents
Roper: How would you feel when you try to contact your mom? Just online, you don't have to meet her. 
Izzy_blight: And I seem to have only taken the worst things from them
Izzy_blight: I don't really know I don't really have any feelings for her
Roper: Which is why you need to confront the source of the worst
Izzy_blight: I barely even know who she is
Roper: Well, you think that would progress things?
Izzy_blight: Not in any way whatsoever
Roper: You're half her genetically
Izzy_blight: I wish I was 0% of her
Izzy_blight: Okay actually that's really mean I'm I'm sorry Mom
Roper: But you aren't. Reality already defines you no matter how mysterious you claim to be
Izzy_blight: Oh I assure you there isn't much mysterious about me
Izzy_blight: I am a piece of shit and I wear it on my sleeve
Roper: You try to be everything, but you proved to be nothing, which is all something, mainly a zoomer-puberty-phase searching identity and meaning
Izzy_blight: I am everything and nothing
Ishipwillowandhunter: why is this still going on
Roper: So a thing
Izzy_blight: Oh I apologize for having feelings Michael
Roper: Michael Jackson
Izzy_blight: I'm Michael Jordan. Stop itGet some help
Ishipwillowandhunter: no sorry I read one of the things above and
Ishipwillowandhunter: You know what never mind
Roper: You shipped Willow and Hunter for all those months. What does taht ship lead too?
Izzy_blight: Oh I'm sorry
Ishipwillowandhunter: what?
Roper: Why not become what you wanna be called? Mich
Neko_yeetus: Womp womp
Ishipwillowandhunter: But
Ishipwillowandhunter: I never said I wanted to be called Mich, for one
Ishipwillowandhunter: For two, Willow and Hunter are characters in toh. I also made this name like a year and a half ago
Roper: Willow Woodson X Hunter Biden
Izzy_blight: Oh look Tweedledee and Tweedledum Suddenly appeartogether out of nowhere
Izzy_blight: You two are real good friends aren't you
Izzy_blight: God what the hell am I
Izzy_blight: I'm sorry
Roper: Imagine calling yourself as a ship in a show unknown even in America

 WATCH LIVE  -  hmmyoudontknowme
Rogue: what show?
Ishipwillowandhunter: What
Neko_yeetus: The owl house? I think
Izzy_blight: My problem is that my presence here is a lost cause and benefits no one at this point but I refuse to accept that fact and give up, these two people here that I love are my entire world And if I leave I don't have anything else
Izzy_blight: But if I stay here all I do is hurt them and myself
Izzy_blight: I'm here because I want to make things better but I only ever make them worse
Rogue: Izzy Im sorry you lost your support, you can talk to me in private whenever you want. But I know you wont
Izzy_blight: I
Izzy_blight: I might actually take you up on on that thank you
Roper: You refuse to see your own problem as a fact, which is why you give up something or being here, which is self-contradictionary 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yes the owl house, love it
Rogue: anytime
Roper: You define yourself as a relation between two characters
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't
Ishipwillowandhunter: I define myself as a sad little lemon boi with an affinity for baking and sociopathic tendencies 
Izzy_blight: I just need someone anyone who cares and will actually listen to me and indulge my feelingsinstead of just retorting me
Roper: What does "Ishipwillowandhunter" mean? Ppl will see and associate with it
Neko_yeetus: I haven‚Äôt finished it but I watched some random episodes
Izzy_blight: Whenever I say things that don't make sense people just point out that they don't make sense but that doesn't help because I'm aware that they don't make sense
Ishipwillowandhunter: It's really good
Roper: Idk if you're aware of it, which is why you need to talk ppl who know you.
Izzy_blight: Okay I
Izzy_blight: I have great news
Rogue: spill

Izzy_blight: I should give Jimmy a hug
Roper: Give him that love. There are more ppl dealing with same problems as you do
Izzy_blight: Michael AJ are you here I'm sorry I want to talk

Izzy_blight: But it feels good It feels very peaceful
Roper: Sleep then. There's no point in suffering here
Izzy_blight: I'm not suffering anymore
Izzy_blight: I don't know how to explain it but the roller coaster ride in my head has reached a smooth point
Izzy_blight: These are the best points
Roper: Control the rise

Ishipwillowandhunter: especially the second part
Ishipwillowandhunter: if you can call it that
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't know how to write fights or non cringe male characters

Izzy_blight: I have so many things I want to say to you but they are affectionate and a wholesome things they are the things that I I really mean
Izzy_blight: I feel like I'm in control of myself for the first timenight and 
Izzy_blight: I am crying over on bed

Izzy_blight: a little bit
Izzy_blight: I will be asleep very soon but I
Izzy_blight: I justI love youAnd I am so sorry
Roper: Maybe if Iloveyouwastaken starts prostitution and OnlyFans both the readers and her are happier
Ishipwillowandhunter: I love you more <3 goodnight Izzy. Sleep well. Tell me what you think of it next time we talk
Roper: Or whoever is that protagonist
Ishipwillowandhunter: Also Roper are you reading it
Izzy_blight: I will thank you. I'm hoping that tomorrow night will be better. Maybe I will come later when most people have already left
Roper: $ 100 for one prostitution? I really work myself like an idiot. Just be woman
Izzy_blight: I think that might be agood idea
Roper: You wrote all of this, Mich?
Ishipwillowandhunter: that will be best, yes. Make sure little people are on and do it. Sorry I can hardly think. Please sleep
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yes Roper, most of it tonight. Why?
Izzy_blight: Yes. Thank you. I love you so much
Roper: You have a lot of creativity to share
Ishipwillowandhunter: Thank you? I think that's a compliment, though I'm not sure. I'm not too happy with my work but it was kinda rushed. thank you for reading
Roper: You fight with your gym-teacher - The Movie ?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Lmao what
Roper: Too much text. What is page 2 about?
Ishipwillowandhunter: sorry baby. It's just a fight, introduction to the male protag, etc
Roper: He fights against Richardo and his gym teacher?
(anon): Make protag is Richardo
Ishipwillowandhunter: lmao 
Ishipwillowandhunter: no
Roper: Delete that philosophy part such as insanity is subjective as feedback. That's up to debate.
Ishipwillowandhunter: I like it as my start
Ishipwillowandhunter: I also just realized something thanks to you
Ishipwillowandhunter: so 
Ishipwillowandhunter: thank you
Roper: Welcome. Katherine Reese is protagonist?
Jbiden: She thinks a lot about being prostitute
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh fuck I forgot that's what I changed her name for
Ishipwillowandhunter: to
Ishipwillowandhunter: yes she does jbiden
Roper: Why does Richardo throw his clothes to her?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Forget ricardo, Roper. Ricardo doesn't exist lmao
Jbiden: How about adding non-binary and trans ppl as representation?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Is english your first language, babe?
Ishipwillowandhunter: I mean I could? I don't see the point
Roper: Richardo... doesn't exist üò±üòî
Jbiden: I am hooked in already. What a twist
Roper: What gym teacher wears a "Suck my cock"-short without getting suspended? Most unrealistic story ever
(anon): Richardo was the friends we made along the way
Roper: Where's Richardo? He likes cigarettes?
Jbiden: I am so triggered and mad right now. How can they remove my most beloved relatable character? I also like cigarettes.
Ishipwillowandhunter: lmao 
Ishipwillowandhunter: oh my god
Ishipwillowandhunter: I am
Ishipwillowandhunter: this is ridiculous I love you all
Roper: Now I can't enjoy this story, knowing I live in a Matrix where everyone can get removed without noticing
(anon): #RichardoNeverForgetti #FreeRichardo
Roper: Who cares about Moxie? We Want Richardo Back. That chad
Jbiden: Who's Mr. Levine? At least that pedo-teacher got his identity
Roper: At what cost? I miss Richardo ;(
(anon): Richardo was like the GTA 4 protagonist
Ishipwillowandhunter: Moxie isn't even her name lmao. Mr. Levine is... you know what, nevermind. I'm sorry, here one second
Roper: Mister is female?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Ricardo is back
Ishipwillowandhunter: take a look
Roper: ONG They added Richardo back
(anon): *claps* üëåüëãüëãüëã
Jbiden: Remember the good old days, as Richardo was here, well here we are again, bois
Ishipwillowandhunter: I like how you focus on the one part of the story that literally doesn't matter at all and wasn't supposed to be there
Ishipwillowandhunter: y'all breath life into Ricardo
Roper: Did Ricardo had a cigarette as he was beaten by his face?
Ishipwillowandhunter: I have no idea what you just said, yes
Roper: Wait, who's Shawn?
Ishipwillowandhunter: he's
Ishipwillowandhunter: He's the guy
Ishipwillowandhunter: that what's her name fights
Jbiden: Shawn is Richardo's shapeshift personality
Roper: Ricardo is the most powerful character here
(anon): Wait, Richardo is pedo now?
Ishipwillowandhunter: y'all are just creating a new universe now
Roper: No. He's a fake pedo gym teacher undercover
(anon): Sorry but can you sum up your story?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Uhh Ricardo throws pants at a woman and then shapeshifts into a guy named Shawn to beat up that same woman
Roper: Interesting. I am thrilled of page 3
Jbiden: One-Punch-Man VS Richardo
Roper: When you want revenge so much, you change identities
Ishipwillowandhunter: now that's a fight for the ages
Roper: That makes the title "Love To Fight - Insane" worthy
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm not sure if I should hate what has been done to ricardo and my story or love it
Jbiden: Imagine Richardo whispering at One-Punch-Man's ears. -999 defense
Roper: Do whatever you want. Haters gonna hate
(anon): Don't touch Richardo
Roper: I am sleepy and hungry anyway. Gn guys

Ishipwillowandhunter: Yes please do I would like
Roper: MAIN MENU > Make Decks
Izzy_blight: I was reading about cognitive behavioral therapy And I had an idea. Whenever I start to feel myself thinking stressful thoughts I have a series of good counterpoint thoughtsThat I make myself think about instead
Izzy_blight: It's actually very effective
Izzy_blight: at soothing the bad feelings
Dtrump: Try a mad house instead.
Izzy_blight: It works like 90% of the time This was only my first day using it but I'm very optimistic about it
Roper: Notice how it's females who need cocknitivr therapy meanwhile makes can jerk it off
Neko_yeetus: Okay everything should be good but I may dip a few more times randomly 
Ishipwillowandhunter: It worked that well? That's really really great, I'm glad you found a way to help

Neko_yeetus: Let me know if there‚Äôs any way I can help iz
Dtrump: Yeah your a virgin.
Roper: "personal reasons"
Izzy_blight: Thank you both of you have already helped me
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm sure you'll be able to. today was your first try, you have time and space 
Neko_yeetus: Idk why but trump it really irking me today
Izzy_blight: Yeah he's acting weird
Izzy_blight: He does that sometimes

Ishipwillowandhunter: Do you mind me asking why that one in particular?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Also what'd he say
Neko_yeetus: It always pisses me off
Roper: Next time, spill facts about how natives were stupid instead straight up saying you don't like to date trans or something
Neko_yeetus: He said I don‚Äôt interact with trans people
Roper: Omg. Different opinions 
Izzy_blight: I mean he interacts with me sometimes so he's lying

Ishipwillowandhunter: Ive never seen any body make him log off

Roper: Comic timing
Dtrump: I am the master of satire.
Izzy_blight: Trump is so silly he

Neko_yeetus: Said every girl he‚Äôs ever touched
Roper: Dtrump is the smartest in chat. Only Whitetrashfucker can out master him
Izzy_blight: I don't I I don't know why but whenever I picture Trump i just imagine like an angry little hedgehog sitting behind a PC from like 1998 in a very dark room
