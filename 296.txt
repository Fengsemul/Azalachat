No excuse to give you, it's true
Hanging by a thread's how I live
I don't know why, but I feel more comfortable
Living in my agony, watching my self-esteem
Go up in flames, acting like I don't
Care what anyone else thinks, when I know truthfully
That that's the furthest thing from how I
Feel, but I'm too proud to open up and ask ya

Charlesd: I still believe Foap is Soup and that recalling your pass was so easy and yet you cant
Charlesd: ofc you have those friends. you took that acc
Foap: no one could take this account without the original email
Treasure_cat: Thats alot of friends god damn
Foap: ik man
Foap: atleast i still got you
Charlesd: do you stillknow Puffer?
Foap: someone who know im real
Foap: yeah, puffer barely gets on tho
Charlesd: you arent. You got Foaps password
Treasure_cat: Yall talking about jointpuffer?
Charlesd: nah just Puffer the guy
Foap: the only way to use this account is with the email
Charlesd: what did Puffer called you earlier?
Charlesd: so you never changed your password?
Foap: nope, no need, to complicated
Charlesd: that means everyone earlier knew your password and can go into your acc, which is dumb#
Foap: youd have to hit 11 things on the keyboard at the right time to get the passwrd right
Charlesd: what did Puffer insulted you?
Foap: gimme a sec, changing classes
Charlesd: you said earlier no need to complicated and now your password is random so you need your mail?
Charlesd: also why telling your cuent password. I asked your troll-password
Foap: this account was unactive for so long that it was locked by the sight and the only way to get back into the account was through the email i set originally, i had to go to my email and had to confirm i was the original owner
Foap: site*
Charlesd: why were you locked in the first place?
Foap: inactive
Charlesd: I never heard of that function
Foap: i havnt touched this account for 3 months
Charlesd: normally azala auto-deleted account
Charlesd: meaning that you could go without password since its registered as new name
Foap: either it was due to inactivity or someone tryed getting into my aaccount
Charlesd: and that occupier just gave up?
Foap: no, the password was the same as its always been
Charlesd: so you lied earlier abt your password being one number?
Foap: no, its always had one number
Charlesd: ok the ultimate question
Foap: sure
Charlesd: whos your best friend
Foap: it was rain69 but she gave up
Foap: and i gave up on her
Charlesd: Oofalladeez: SOAP U DIDNT JUJU ON THA FUCKIN BEAT SOAP
Foap: FINALLY SOMEONE GETS THE NAME
Foap: you have now become my bestfriend ._.
Charlesd: bro youre the imposter
Foap: I REMEMBER THAT
Foap: damn, good memories XD

Treasure_cat: That was one of my first alt accs on here
Charlesd: at Septembre 2023, there was a Soap51 doing his fav actinity
Treasure_cat: this acc i have rn is my main
Foap: september*
Charlesd: and its similar with Soup51, so at some point you faked Soup51, but why
Foap: soup51?
Charlesd: if you arent Soup51 but Soap51
Foap: iver never said i was either
Charlesd: Foap: i wouldve been soap
Foap: wouldve
Foap: key word
