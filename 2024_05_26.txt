Izzy_blight: Jimmy is a fucked-up nasty fucking fuck. He's a danger to both himself and everyone who lives around him, especially children. His father had a really bad past and was abusive. He raped and beat Jimmy to a pulp and had Jimmy's dog killed in front of him. This caused him to take drugs and was the start of the beginning of his psychosis and delusions, the heroin addiction, violent tendencies, alcoholism, and mental problems. May he rot in a bed of wilted tulips, the sick fuck.

Assfucking: I HAVE A GIANT BLACK PUSSY ON MY LAP
Assfucking: AWWWWW YEAH PURRING KITTY
Handrollq: Can you shut up? Like obviously nobody cares
Assfucking: hey sup?
Assfucking: jk FUUUUUCCCKKKK YOOOOOOUUUUUU
Assfucking: *dances*
Assfucking: OH FUCK
Assfucking: I CAN'T STOP PELVIC THRUSTING
Assfucking: UNGH UNGH UNGH UNGH MY FUCKING DESK IS BOUNCING
Assfucking: SOMEONE CALL 911 TELL THEM THE RHYTHM HAS ME
Assfucking: MY MASSIVE CAWK
Handrollq: Shut. Up. This is just sad.
Assfucking: SUCK IT N00B
Assfucking: NOBODY LIKES YOU
Assfucking: i am beloved by millions
Handrollq: I believe you have some value in this universe
Assfucking: i have immense value
Handrollq: why wasting here?
Assfucking: i multitask :D
Handrollq: my mom is your task?
Assfucking: *buuuuuurp*
Assfucking: cool story bruh lol
Handrollq: you still multi-task into the void. Theres noone except me and you
Assfucking: You don't know who is lurking
Assfucking: you just presume the number is zero
Handrollq: the fact that noone reacts makes it worthless. They will forget the next day
Assfucking: THat presumes so many things
Handrollq: ok how many ppl you think is lurking here if everyone is silent? 5 million?
Assfucking: dunno it's an unknown 
Handrollq: this website is unknown to most
Assfucking: true 5mil seems extreme lol
Assfucking: I would guess like maybe a dozen?
Dtrump: more like 3
Handrollq: so you put a show for 2 ppl. Bravo.
Assfucking: somewhere between 3 and 12 seems a reasonable range to me
Dtrump: 12 is too high
Handrollq: 12? You think 12 can shut up and stare at your offensive gibberish?
Assfucking: says you?
Assfucking: based on what data?
Assfucking: just your feeeeeewingS?
Assfucking: *spits*
Assfucking: to your feelings
Handrollq: whats your data that ppl are staring?
Assfucking: I don't have the data I SAID that I GUESS a dozen but that it is an UNKNOWN
Handrollq: You assume we arent AIs. Based on your intuition
Assfucking: all of that has ALREADY BEEN SAID you DUMMY
Dtrump: oh there is?
Dtrump: ais?
Assfucking: so KEEP UP
Assfucking: I assume this is reality and not a simulation yada yada fucking low IQ trash don't even try
Assfucking: ugh
Assfucking: UGH
Assfucking: you people
Handrollq: i say based on my experience that you have to be pathetic to stare in this site all day and being silent, which is a very low proportion of this world population.
Assfucking: .....I mean
Assfucking: I WISH I could agree with you there
Assfucking: I really do
Handrollq: its a game lobby chat. Not snapchat
Assfucking: BUT
Assfucking: I think most of the world is fr retarded
Handrollq: not that desperate to go in this chat
Handrollq: just you, me, dtrump going there everyday and thats it
Assfucking: don't feign disinterest in this chat or relegate it to a low quality enterprise when you are here with me yapping away ;)
Handrollq: why even caring? Go to some debate-forum if you care about high-quality-talk
Assfucking: do yourself the favor of respecting your own choice if not mine LOL
Handrollq: I have no choice but to respect you
Assfucking: why thank you sir :)
Handrollq: You have no valid data, yet you can weight all the collected data to a side, and right now no more than 2 are staring. Maybe a third player bumped here by accident but thats it
Assfucking: occasionally I blurt out absurdities to relieve some odd inner sort of tension
Assfucking: I always hope someone just builds on it LOL
Handrollq: same
Handrollq: the blurting absurdities-part by saying that theres no audience
Handrollq: Assfucking got fucked by silence
Assfucking: no sorry I am in a match lol
Assfucking: Alt Tabbing back to other monitor
Handrollq: as if anyone wants to match with a guy named "Assfucking". The standards are that low?
Assfucking: Well I try to mix a combination of crude and crass exclamations with high sentence and philosophy
Assfucking: I find the juxtaposition droll
Handrollq: Touche
Assfucking: I used to hand around the Azala Discord but there are a few for real pedos on there
Assfucking: I didn't want to be on a watchlist
Assfucking: *hang around
Handrollq: As I said, pathetic
Assfucking: Yeah overall I found the several hundred people in that Discord to be of low character
Assfucking: I could feel my IQ dropping by the day
Assfucking: speaking of
Assfucking: *bong hit*
Handrollq: I bet your parents doesnt know of this place. And so your doctor testing your IQ
Assfucking: My parents are really old
Assfucking: in their 70s I am also not young lol
Handrollq: Do they spread the truth about Vietnam War or followed their orders?
Assfucking: hah as if my Dad was butch enough for Vietnam dude's a failed poet
Handrollq: a democrat?
Assfucking: yeah :(
Handrollq: We all do mistakes
Assfucking: I come from the bottom lol
Handrollq: do you have any favorite philosopher?

22:25:31Sunday, 26 May, 2024
Dtrump: stalin
Assfucking: hmmmm probably Hume
Assfucking: Hume and Kant are tough to get around
Assfucking: Hume's Fork, Critique of Pure reason etc
Assfucking: Rawls is a good modern guy, Veil of Ignorance is his big claim to fame
Handrollq: Billy Dunaway and Michael Pendlebury for defining realism, Aristotle & Plato for their influence
Handrollq: i am just new in philosophy
Assfucking: An Idiot's Guide to Philosophy isn't a bad start
Assfucking: or anything like that
Assfucking: IMO the fine details aren't super important it's the big ideas, the gist
Assfucking: knowing that is enough
Assfucking: read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance once you are up to it
Allrise: I will prob never grasp it 100% through
Assfucking: don't need to
Handrollq: https://onecosmos.blogspot.com/2009/08/critique-of-critique-of-pure-reason.html
Handrollq: Checkmate Kant.
Assfucking: like nobody READS Kant you read summaries of his ideas lol
Assfucking: his writing is awful
Handrollq: thats kinda sad if you think about it
Handrollq: but yeah I heard that too about his writings
Assfucking: engh I mean academics in the Humanities have always like to write in high sentence so he is part of a tradition
Assfucking: but yeah I hate that tradition
Assfucking: my Bachelor's Thesis was on exactly that lol
Handrollq: but Kant is also against practical reason too?
Assfucking: so in a broader view I recommend gathering wisdom from many different sources
Assfucking: I disagree with Kant on some things
Handrollq: Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason attempts to change the study of metaphysics and philosophy by altering how philosophers view the world. Instead of asking how the mind conforms to the objects around it, Kant wondered how the objects conform to the nature of the mind.20.03.2023

Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant | Summary & Analysis

study.com
Handrollq: Kant wrote so much, ofc ppl will disagree on some
Assfucking: Philosophy has been a human enterprise for thousands of years and certain people have manifested ideas that have proven to be indispensable chapterheads in the timeline of the discipline 
Handrollq: but they were dispensable
Hello19: It's so quiet 
Handrollq: maybe because you ignore discenters
Assfucking: Love him or hate him Kant's Categorical Imperative is a powerful idea with weighty logic behind it
Assfucking: as is Hume's more destructively playful ideas like the Fork
Hello19: Huh?
Handrollq: so is Socrates method of discussion if I recall it right
Assfucking: the Socratic Method of asking lots of clarifying and leading questions rather than dictating truth
Assfucking: knowing the names of the people associated with first saying or writing down the idea isn't nearly as important as knowing the idea lol
Handrollq: I imagined it more of a dialectic from claims to objections and the last objection is the most valid one like in https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Does_objective_reality_exist%3F
Assfucking: knowing the name of the person is great for showing off but the worth comes from knowing the ideas
Handrollq: true
Handrollq: how would you determine teh "winner" in a debate?
Assfucking: well a dialectic is not a debate lol
Handrollq: its a discourse or not? an exchage of two opposing things?
Assfucking: no no a debate involves RHETORIC
Assfucking: such as appeals to emotion
Dtrump: arthymic
Assfucking: a dialectic involves the stripping away of those emotional elements to just the facts of the matter and logic
Assfucking: so in a sense the debate and the dialectic are polar opposite endeavors 
Handrollq: which is what Wikipedia-debates and Wikiversity tries to do?
Handrollq: a debate is 2 ppl arguing, yet it can be more objective
Assfucking: well anything calling itself a debate and being televised with a podium and audience is obviously NOT a dialectic
Assfucking: regardless of what they say it is LOL
Assfucking: dialectics are few and far between these days sadly
Handrollq: you dont think debate can lead to truth?
Assfucking: it certainly CAN
Assfucking: because truth is persuasive 
Assfucking: but so are appeals to emotion
Assfucking: which cloud reason
Assfucking: so it's a less ideal environment for seeking truth than a dialectic 
Handrollq: Which is why we need to set rules to be more evidence-based
Assfucking: debates are more for entertainment of a higher intellectual order 
Assfucking: a debate is a high IQ version of a roast session amongst some homies LOL
Handrollq: Debates are good for confronting opposite views imo in direct honest way. Whats the betetr alternative for debate?
Handrollq: were debating right now
Assfucking: no this isn't a debate because there are no rules no points and no known for sure audience LOL
Assfucking: and we are in agreement :D
Handrollq: there are intuitive rules
Handrollq: hm
Assfucking: this is a metadiscussion about conversations ethics and debate vs dialectic
Handrollq: I respect your comprehension in this meta-non-debate
Assfucking: if we were both in front of podiums with timers and an audience then I wouldn't need someone to tell me that we were debating
Handrollq: but discussion. Yet we disagree on the importance of debate I guess
Assfucking: the context would be clear but here the context is the opposite of that so to me that is also clear :)
Handrollq: we dont need a timer for a debate
Handrollq: its a very loose debate
Assfucking: well most debates have a timer otherwise people talk over each other
Assfucking: and it's like CNN's old show Crossfire
Assfucking: which pretended to be a debate show but really was Jerry Springer with academics 
Handrollq: a formal discussion on a particular matter in a public meeting or legislative assembly, in which opposing arguments are put forward and which usually ends with a vote.
Handrollq: the 2. definition is:"argue about (a subject), especially in a formal manner.
"
Handrollq: its informal so youre right
Assfucking: well more formal debates tend to have a topic and they poll the audience at the start of the event and at the end of it to compare which side swayed the audience more
Assfucking: sometimes they allow some free for all back and forth as well as timed statements 
Assfucking: it's all a giant trust me story we don't know if people are telling the truth in the polls but it's the best we can do at that level anyways
Assfucking: until we have lie detectors that are 100% infallible lol
Handrollq: https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/debate_1#:~:text=%2Fd%C9%AA%CB%88be%C9%AAt%2F-,%2Fd%C9%AA%CB%88be%C9%AAt%2F,first%20ever%20televised%20presidential%20debate : 1. formal discussion 2. "an argument or a discussion expressing different opinions"
Handrollq: so your claim is more authoritative than mine, yet any discussion in the second definition is a debate like this
Assfucking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZRcYaAYWg4

So this is a pretty formal debate with a stated topic that one side is for and one side is against with audience polling before and after
Assfucking: timed sides etc
Assfucking: pretty standard and VERY worth watching IMO
Handrollq: And I used the word "debate" differently. My bad. next time I say discussion
Dtrump: gay
Handrollq: you know a journalist is bad when they lose an university debate
Assfucking: I dunno there are some smart kids in Uni still among all the snowflakes
Assfucking: some journos are morons
Handrollq: I forgot which one yet he disbelieves the Y2K-bug despite linux-developers saying its real
Handrollq: idk about 9/11 through. I think its real and the result of US security's incompetence of easily hijacking airplanes
Assfucking: I love the conspiracy guys lol
Handrollq: it was just one guy. but yeah
Handrollq: what does "Pure Reason" mean for Kant?

Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh, wonderful. I managed to make it here.
Izzy_blight: You're alive 
Izzy_blight: but unfortunately here
Izzy_blight: What happened
Ishipwillowandhunter: Discord is unavailable to me right now. I missed you. When? 3 hours ago? This morning? Yesterday? 
Izzy_blight: God. Maybe it's better if I don't know 
Izzy_blight: We can talk about it if you want to but I doubt you do
Izzy_blight: I've been worried 
Izzy_blight: I'm just glad you're alive i guess 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I know, and I am so so sorry. I tried, I did. I came to you as soon as I could. Im sorry if I seem abrasive. Im just irritated that this device is glitching and my body aches. I'm not sure what to say but im willing to answer any questions you have 
Dtrump: stupid gay drama
Izzy_blight: I don't know what questions to ask. I'm worried i'll probably ask the wrong ones
Izzy_blight: Yes trump that was usually happens here
Ishipwillowandhunter: No, no gay issues this time. There are no wrong questions love, ask whatever comes to mind 
Izzy_blight: My brain is going really fast all of a sudden yet its going nowhere. Im sorry 
Ishipwillowandhunter: :( I'm sorry 
Izzy_blight: Well of course the biggest question i have is where youve been the last... what, 3? 4? days? Idk i assume lots of unspeakable things have happened 
Izzy_blight: Im lagging 
Izzy_blight: Im sorry for everything that happened 
06:17:23Wednesday, 29 May, 2024
Ishipwillowandhunter: I was last on Wednesday of last week. I've been at home, with no devices. Nothing bit my thoughts to keep me company. It's okay baby.
Izzy_blight: I don't keep track of the day s, time is mostly irrelevant to me. But that sounds like a while ago. God im sorry 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Nearly a week and I know what you mean, the days have no substance as long as you count out pains body
Dtrump: always fighting never sloving
Izzy_blight: We dont fight that much anymore. Mostly it was because of this place that we used to fight nearly every day 
Izzy_blight: Ive been spending too much time here again since you were gone 
Izzy_blight: Ive done things i regret
Izzy_blight: Im sorry 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Things?
Ishipwillowandhunter: It's alright love. I've done things I regret too
Izzy_blight: fuck
Ishipwillowandhunter: Not cutting. Eventually the emotional pain becomes so strong that physical pain doesn't do anything 
06:31:20Wednesday, 29 May, 2024
Dtrump: gay
Izzy_blight: God damn it
Izzy_blight: I can't even imagine what 
Izzy_blight: I hate lag. Fucking thing sucks
Izzy_blight: Everything suxks
Ishipwillowandhunter: I can't disagree old friend. I'm gonna have to do it eventually, I realize. I have few options 
Izzy_blight: Sorry. I
Izzy_blight: You
Izzy_blight: Wait what 
Izzy_blight: No
Izzy_blight: No no no no 
Izzy_blight: Fuck
Izzy_blight: I'm can't even put words together they're like a puzzle that i lost 98% of the pieces for 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Come on love. I've been saying it for a long time. Im getting close to that point where I have no other choice 
Izzy_blight: No
Izzy_blight: Fuck that
Izzy_blight: There's always a choice
Izzy_blight: Every second is ripe with infinite posibility
06:45:18Wednesday, 29 May, 2024
Izzy_blight: I could make a series of choices in this very moment that could fix a lot of things were i so inclined 
Ishipwillowandhunter: That's true, but there are only minor deviations of each variation of each possibility. It gets to the point where you can compact them into a single option, they're so similar 
Dtrump: minors?
Ishipwillowandhunter: Could you now? I suppose that's where me and you differ. I am backed up against a wall. I have nowhere to go 
Izzy_blight: It's getting hard to breathe my hands are shaking and words dont exust
Izzy_blight: Why dont they exist 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I learned plenty and forgot more
Izzy_blight: I dont know what that means 
Izzy_blight: I just want this to stop 
Izzy_blight: It's like a nightmare but we're all wide awake 
Izzy_blight: What the fuck
Ishipwillowandhunter: Me too. I'm sorry sweet girl. None of this was earned. Our pain isn't deserved. I think we need to stop asking why. Love always has reason, hate and cruelty are free floating, wandering evils.
Dtrump: moises
Izzy_blight: I'd ask what i did to deserve this but i know everything i did. I thaunts me every day
Izzy_blight: You nothing. No deserve. I want to kill this. This corrupted life
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm an addict to the pain. Because without it, I know nothing amd the absence of everything is scarier 
Izzy_blight: I think... i understand that. I wish you didn't have to 
06:59:15Wednesday, 29 May, 2024
Izzy_blight: I wish it more than anything in this world 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I know baby. I'm sorry. The universe has been cruel, teaching us it's worst commonalities and none of the good ones
Izzy_blight: We were never going to have easy life, things were against us from the start but it's gotten so much harder than any of us could have expected 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I want to see my dad panic when I ask him why as blood drips from my fingertips. I want to dare him to get angry
Dtrump: angry midget
Izzy_blight: Christ
Izzy_blight: My baby 
Izzy_blight: Why did it have to happen like this 
Izzy_blight: This cang
Ishipwillowandhunter: I used to wake up from nightmares relieved. Now I wake up from them, sun on my face, and I beg them to take me back. They have substance that unfamiliarity brings.
Izzy_blight: My soul
Izzy_blight: I need to speak so many words but what can i say 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I need to try and make you understand 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I need to try and understand 
Izzy_blight: I need to sa
07:13:12Wednesday, 29 May, 2024
Izzy_blight: Im approaching a complete breakdown. Once there i will either no longer be able to say a single word or i'll say way too much
Ishipwillowandhunter: You know I don't want to, right? I don't crave death because it's appealing, or because I have any abstract convictions that it'll be nice. Have you seen the falling man, the rumoured men that fell from the Twin Towers the day the planes struck? 
Ishipwillowandhunter: They jumped, not because they wanted to. But because the glass shattering around them, the concrete crumbling beneath their feet, the fires lapping at their heels lead a greater fear than talking did.
Ishipwillowandhunter: The fall, the height didn't become any less terrifying. It was just overlapped by the fear of being crushed beneath a 30 story building 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't desire Death's grip. It just seems the better option.
Izzy_blight: I don't want to die. Thats a lie. I know that deep down. I want this life to mean something. It still can. But i often feel like I'd rather die than live in this twisted world
Izzy_blight: I don't want to exist in a world where these things have happened 
Dtrump: douchebag
Ishipwillowandhunter: I get that. The events of our past stain our present and it makes it harder to bear
Izzy_blight: It's just too much
Izzy_blight: But it doesn't have to always be like this
Izzy_blight: Are we really going to do this? Do we really think it's necessary 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't know what you're saying. I have no choice but to live with "this"
Dtrump: douchefag
Izzy_blight: Things cannot be reversed. But they don't have to define you 
Ishipwillowandhunter: They don't define me. I am made up not only of what I am but of what I want and can never be. That is why I seek the great consolation of death 
Dtrump: made up of fibers
Izzy_blight: I'm starting to lose control but i can't 
Izzy_blight: Not now
07:27:10Wednesday, 29 May, 2024
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm tired and my body is spasming. I keep involuntarily dropping this
Izzy_blight: There are so many things you can still have. A permanent solution is not the answer to a temporary problem. But I'm sure you know that
Izzy_blight: I hate that. Fuck. Okay keep it together 
Izzy_blight: Shit im starting to blank again i lost my train of thought 
Izzy_blight: Not now brain dont you fucking do this to me keep thinking you piece of shit
Ishipwillowandhunter: No. I don't mean for permanence. I want to grasp the edge and pull myself up. I know how close I am to a hospital. I know how long it'd take me to bleed out
Izzy_blight: There are so many things I wish you didn't have to know
Izzy_blight: Things i wish i didn't have to know 
Dtrump: secerts
Izzy_blight: A little learning is a dangerous thing
Izzy_blight: I'm getting distracted
Ishipwillowandhunter: Distraction Osgood. I can't raise my arm. Gonna pass out. Sorry darling 
Izzy_blight: I guess at least you're not taking the worst possible option . I hope. I'm running out of words again 
Izzy_blight: Im mentally backed into a corner and I can tell im going to be there for a while. Seorry. Rest well please 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I'm not. I'm not gonna die. I have a will. One most don't. Goodnight honey 
Izzy_blight: My legs feel like jelly
Izzy_blight: Yes you do 
Izzy_blight: Strongest person i know 
Izzy_blight: It's not a good night but i hope tomorrow is better 
Izzy_blight: J love you 
07:41:07Wednesday, 29 May, 2024
Izzy_blight: I can't remember the last good night. Or day. Or minute. Or second
Dtrump: die harder
Izzy_blight: That is a great name for a die hard sequel 
Izzy_blight: I'm sure somebody's used it

Stardust12: im going somehwere today anyways and i hope nothing bad happens
Izzy_blight: Hope not. Super duper sorry 
Stardust12: and im getting a new phone too
Izzy_blight: Nokia phones are the best 
Stardust12: I had samsungs all my life
Izzy_blight: You could run over a Nokia with a semi truck and the truck would fall apart
Stardust12: oooo
Izzy_blight: Those phones will be the only thing that survives the apocalypse
Stardust12: reak
Stardust12: real 
Stardust12: brb
Stardust12: yea ppl are so mean to me
Izzy_blight: people are terrible. Especially here
Zelenne: If theres no internet, what will you use?
Izzy_blight: A gun
Izzy_blight: On jimmy
Zelenne: not radio?
Inker275: i hate my life
Izzy_blight: Don't have a radio, my dad had one but I don't know where it went 
Izzy_blight: oh I'm sorry what's wrong 
Inker275: everything
Inker275: one of my friends are being a bitch because my boyfriend cant baby me
Izzy_blight: Oh no 
Inker275: and some other shit idfk
Inker275: might kill myself later
Treasure_cat: hi
Izzy_blight: Wowser
Inker275: might either strangle myself or starve myself to death
Inker275: if you have any other ideas, please suggest them to me
Zelenne: but the benefit with radios are that they are cheap, easy to use and you can always catch informative waves compare to Internet and TV especially after apocalypse
Treasure_cat: Why am i the only one who wants to move on and not fucking kms
Inker275: you said you wanted to kill yourself yesterday, you cant be talking
Treasure_cat: Well, i dont, yall need to move on
Zelenne: but in case theres an internet shutdown, going outside and radio helps
Inker275: especially chloe
Zelenne: why do those ppl always want to kill themselves instead listening to KKTV
Inker275: i know shes my friend, but she need to stop being a baby about shit like this
Inker275: she wants to kill herself all because lucien wants to baby me
Izzy_blight: If there was no internet maybe I'd finally do something with my life
Inker275: again, i know im her friend, but thats the stupidest shit ive ever seen anyone kill themseves over
Zelenne: you wouldnt. Theres still radio, TV and lucid dreams
Zelenne: ppl barely change from themselves
Izzy_blight: I have none of those things 
Stardust12: i wanna commit too
Zelenne: you dont have ability to sleep more?
Stardust12: https://i.imghippo.com/files/xEzA21716985445.jpg
Inker275: shame its access denied

Stardust12: im not risking going to jail for murderer
Inker275: its not murder if i asked for it

Zelenne: Stardust12: im not risking going to jail for murderer - Azala 2024
Treasure_cat: Ya, dont kill yourself, suicide is never the fucking answer
Izzy_blight: Jesus christ this is goofy and not in a good way
Inker275: ofc it is the answer
Inker275: life fucking sucks

He grew up in the North side neighborhood and attended the University of Missouri before joining the United States Air Force at age 25. Jenkins served in Iraq for three years as a pilot instructor, but when his tour ended, he turned to drugs to stay afloat. In 2001, he was arrested and indicted for selling methamphetamine in New Orleans.

18:11:35Saturday, 1 June, 2024
Izzy_blight: Jimmy reached down for my princess parts
Ishipwillowandhunter: Happy pride month gaywads
Izzy_blight: ah fuck
Izzy_blight: I was just going to bed. Maybe.probably 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Well that's unfortunate. I assumed you'd be going to sleep later than this, based off of the past. But hey. Assume makes an ass out of me and u 
Ishipwillowandhunter: U and me
Izzy_blight: I sleep whenever it comes to me. I have no schedule. I try to keep on e but it's RNG at this point 
18:38:23Saturday, 1 June, 2024
Ishipwillowandhunter: Understandable. I try to keep a schedule but I always wake up feeling sick so I don't really care anymore 
Izzy_blight: There are things in life you cannot choose: how you feel.
Ishipwillowandhunter: Sorry did you say something 
Izzy_blight: I say many things that nobody hears. And no one ever will
Ishipwillowandhunter: Selfishness is a pit that cannot be filled 
Izzy_blight: I would know all about that I'm sure 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Everyone does. The human soul has an astounding capacity for greed. It's only natural, after all. Self preservation is inherently selfish 
Izzy_blight: Ain't that swell.
Izzy_blight: I'm starting to wonder why I love everybody else so much when deep down they're all just like me. I try to separate myself from humanity as much as possible. Sadly, it's one of few things in my life that can't be solved with denial and negative reinforcement.
Izzy_blight: Maybe "solved" is a strong word for it 
Izzy_blight: I guess it's just in my nature. We can't fight nature. We can't fight change, can't fight... gravity.
Izzy_blight: My whole life, all I ever did was fight 
Ishipwillowandhunter: "They can't just walk around being gay" things my dad says that are not explainable 
Izzy_blight: The walls are closing now, too tightly to ignore this time. And I'm starting to see that there is no reason to fight. Everything I do is just a waste
Izzy_blight: Yeah I think he got hit in the head a few thousand too many times as a kid
Izzy_blight: I'd sure like to add a few thousand more to that tally
Izzy_blight: With a sledgehammer 
19:05:12Saturday, 1 June, 2024
Ishipwillowandhunter: You're too sweet baby. I'm sorry 
Izzy_blight: No I'm sorry. For. I don't know. just everything
Izzy_blight: I was sweet once. I'm souring quickly as the walls I've so painstakingly crafted break down and what little remains of my psyche is buried alive by the full assault of the truth
Izzy_blight: the truth I've known all this time but could never accept 
Rain69: Hey
Izzy_blight: What was clear in a dream, suddenly makes no sense. No surreal rescues. No easy, magic way out. But you are awake.
Izzy_blight: Hello traveler
Rain69: Hi
Ishipwillowandhunter: My dad just insinuated that I want to be a girl. Out of nowhere. Am i fuckin high
Sannkaed: possibly
Izzy_blight: I think he is 
Sannkaed: i agree
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh he definitely is
Rain69: Hi mich
Izzy_blight: I don't know how he would come up with this shit if he wasn't on on PCP and angel dust
Ishipwillowandhunter: Man smokes an eighth a day
Ishipwillowandhunter: On a bad day*
Ishipwillowandhunter: Hey Kei <3
Rain69: Hiiiiii
Rain69: i have news rly good news
Sannkaed: spill
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yeah? What's it?
Izzy_blight: I have a feeling its going to be a bad day 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Most definitely 
Izzy_blight: Great.
Izzy_blight: I love it when that happens 
Sannkaed: L
Ishipwillowandhunter: Hold on brb
Izzy_blight: I hope not
Ishipwillowandhunter: alrighty
Izzy_blight: I have just resisted doing something very bad and stupid that i wanted to do very badly for some reason.
Izzy_blight: I guess that means I at least haven't completely drowned yet.i still care
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yes, good job love. Seriously, I don't know what it is you stopped yourself from doing but I'm glad you resisted 
Izzy_blight: Nothing earth shattering but it would have made things much worse for me specifically right now and for once I've for some reason decided that I don't want that. Thank you 
19:32:01Saturday, 1 June, 2024
Izzy_blight: I should give you a hug but i have no arms
Ishipwillowandhunter: No matter the severity, I'm glad you didn't. Me neither, I'm having them replaced
Izzy_blight: I'm still looking for them along with my left foot after the magnetic jacket incident, that experiment was always going to be a disaster. It was a harebrained idea from the start honestly
Izzy_blight: I was feeling and thinking things a minute ago i think but now nothing at all. Zero brain activity. Tired. Curl up under your bed and protect yoy
Izzy_blight: oh no thinking is back. It hurts
Izzy_blight: Oh well serenity was nice while it lasted 
Ishipwillowandhunter: If I left do you think you could get some sleep? I promse I'll be okay
Dtrump: np
Izzy_blight: Yes. My brain is weak enough that its sleepy dissipating again. Where did the word sleepy come from, i didn't type that? I guess that just shows where my subconscious head is at. I hope you will be. All my love and prayers 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I love you Izzy, get some sleep. Bye <3
Izzy_blight: I should go before i turn anymore into joe biden. I'm going to go pass out for 20hours. Love you son and other people bye bye

Lazurus: good to be back
Izzy_blight: Back in the saddle 
Lazurus: I wanna ride someone like a saddle but enough about that
Izzy_blight: Horsie ride ðŸŽ 
Izzy_blight: How are you 
Lazurus: I'm good horny but that's an easy fix I denying myself
Lazurus: what about you how have you been
Izzy_blight: A bomb went off in my head. The bullet lodged in my brain moved a fatal, microscopic distance.
Izzy_blight: As of last night it's joever
Lazurus: sounds painful
Izzy_blight: You have no idea 
Izzy_blight: Or at least I hope you dont
Lazurus: hey you wanna see my pussy
Lazurus: and I might have some idea but I don't want to go into it
Izzy_blight: Sorry 
Izzy_blight: I very much want to go into my experience. Unfortunately I don't know how to 
Lazurus: well I guess it doesnt hurt to try
Lazurus: https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:465y4rgp6pcwo6eijioezt2w/bafkreihkkzlvvgj4lf527pswhnekwlvuccdmlscxjqc7nju33do2ggtzgi@jpeg
Lazurus: and there is my son
Izzy_blight: Beautiful boy
Lazurus: he is goofy
Izzy_blight: It's a long story. Several years long. Oh like the Disney dog?
Lazurus: no his names Mike but he acts goofy so I call him that but enough abt the cat what up with you
(anon): Hellaur??
Lazurus: hellurrr
Izzy_blight: That's two goofy cuties named mike that I know now. Very good 
Hello19: Hello
Lazurus: hey hello how are ya xD
Izzy_blight: Oh you know. abusive ex that I'm still madly in love with abused me some more as usual
Izzy_blight: Blocked me on discord and we'll probably never see each other again. Ill never recover
Lazurus: ah love problems not my wheelhouse
Izzy_blight: not mine either but I got them in spades
Lazurus: I can try though same Micheal I'm thinking of?
Izzy_blight: Probably yeah 
Lazurus: well idk then I haven't talked to him in a while but I don't have any socials so I don't think it would matter
Izzy_blight: Yeah he left azala along with me a while back
Izzy_blight: But that's not in effect anymore it seems 
Lazurus: yeah I heard trump talking about that a while ago sucks but people do drift apart a lot 
Lazurus: its natural I guess
Izzy_blight: Oh I didn't mean me and him, he's not my ex. We're just besties. We don't like each other like that. Except that one time 
Izzy_blight: I think you know my ex. They left too
Lazurus: I remember don't remind me
Lazurus: I don't think we've met idk
Izzy_blight: Do you remember a yeetus? Yellow color, slightly obnoxious?
Izzy_blight: That's them 
Lazurus: yeah no I haven't met them
Izzy_blight: Ah. Count yourself lucky 
Lazurus: I assume its for the better I don't huh
Lazurus: wait neko yeetus
Lazurus: if so then yes I've met them
Izzy_blight: Oh, yes.
Izzy_blight: That one 
Izzy_blight: Real bastard, I see now. Everything everyone told me about them is true. I knew it was, I just didn't want to accept it
11:58:46Sunday, 2 June, 2024
Izzy_blight: Terrible person but I still love them. It's pathetic
Lazurus: that's how it goes sometimes hun you just gotta move on
Izzy_blight: Fuck off with that. Everyone keeps saying that 
Lazurus: I know its hard but I didn't say it would be easy
Izzy_blight: I don't want to get over it. I want to get under it instead 
Lazurus: I used to think the same way until I realized it was true and you will with time but it takes just that time
Izzy_blight: I sacrificed everything for that asshole
Izzy_blight: And I'm repaid like this 
Izzy_blight: I hate that I cant stop loving them
Lazurus: I understand where your at but you shouldn't feel better find something to keep you happy
Lazurus: bitter*
Izzy_blight: Maybe I should find a hobby that doesn't involve sticking my hands down my pants and staring at a screen like a fucking zombie. Maybe I should try knitting, or fucking gardening, or anything that doesn't involve being a degenerate pervert. Better yet, maybe I should just disappear already.
Lazurus: I mean yeah those are great options although degeneracy isnt a bad thing but yeah try gardening or cooking or oh maybe write a song and then burn the paper
Izzy_blight: I don't enjoy anything anymore. I doubt I'd enjoy any of those things 
Izzy_blight: Depression is kicking my ass
Izzy_blight: Has been for a while 
Lazurus: unless you have a porn addiction and if so don't look me up or youll find out odd things and depression is life long hun
Lazurus: its your choice if you let it eat you that the magic in it
Lazurus: if you believe in such either that or its the irony
Izzy_blight: I have a severe porn and junk food addiction, my health is deteriorating faster than the value of bitcoin. That's okay, I hope to not have to be alive too much longer 
Izzy_blight: But for longer than I'd like. Maybe another decade. I have business to handle 
Lazurus: hun don't think like that I know its hard not to but things get better with time
Lazurus: trust and believe
Izzy_blight: I trusted and believed. You know what I got for it? Betrayal, disappointment and trauma.
Lazurus: hey it happens to everyone trust me that's why I got into doing weird shit with people but it will get better just let the wound heal
Izzy_blight: I'm just hoping maybe I can spite everyone who's hurt me by going out in the most pathetic way possible. They stab me in the back, shoot me in the face and then wish me a good life. A good life? Fuck you. You're the ones making my life a living hell
Izzy_blight: With friends like those I'd hate to have enemies 
Lazurus: well I just hope you don't let this bottle up and fester
Lazurus: also I get that statement but you cant always look at the negitave or that's all you'll see look at this like its a learning curve
Izzy_blight: I have no choice. I have no one to go to
Izzy_blight: Oh it's one hell of a curve alright 
Izzy_blight: A downward slope into hell
Izzy_blight: What am I supposed to be learning from this? "People suck, be alone?" Cause that's what I'm getting
Lazurus: maybe not that far but it does feel like that
Lazurus: you just have to find someone who likes you for you
Lazurus: no matter how hard that might be
Izzy_blight: Fat chance of that, given that I'm Isabel Caroline Prosko. Maybe if I was someone else but nah this ain't it
Lazurus: well you never know maybe you'll regret the things you've said about yourself or maybe not who knows but time
Izzy_blight: I've been planning to kill myself since I was a preteen. To me everything in life is a distraction. Death is the goal. I've wasted too much time on distractions like romance or friendships. No point in continuing with that stuff. I'll just leave behind grievers and that's not what I want
Izzy_blight: Or at least that's what I tell myself and everyone else. Secretly i think it's kind of a cry for help. It's gone unanswered thus far
Lazurus: well maybe you just haven't tried asking the right people because talking to me might be helping now but as you said it may just be a distraction for yourself but if thats what you need then I can help
Lazurus: and if you kys I'd miss ya I don't talk to many people on here anyways
Izzy_blight: I'm too weak and self-loathing to help myself. I have a dream of someone coming along by chance, and doing it for me. Pulling me out of this just by being themselves. That's what I thought AJ was going to be for me, back then. I was young and naÃ¯ve. What was clear in a dream, suddenly makes no sense. No surreal rescues. No easy, magic way out. But you are awake.
Izzy_blight: Oh I won't don't worry. Unfortunately I can't. Obligations, like I said. It will probably be a while 
Lazurus: there's not an easy way out in life trust me I've tried everything you just have to let time heal your wounds
Lazurus: and I'm glad you wont
Izzy_blight: I want my life to be a cheesy romance novel instead of the grimdark Wattpad fiction that it is. I want to know what it feels like to find the one. I thought I had 
Izzy_blight: I banked everything on it. And I lost it all. The nothing that I already had
Izzy_blight: Now it feels like a waste to try again
Lazurus: well you always have to try if you want that void to fill
Izzy_blight: My relentless efforts to fill it have made it unfillable
Izzy_blight: Now all I can do is cram more hentai and french fries into and pretend its ok
Lazurus: it does feel that way huh
Izzy_blight: It feels like I want it 
Izzy_blight: I'm not sure what I really want 
Izzy_blight: Feels like I deserve this 
Lazurus: no one truly deserves it hun it just happens
12:44:29Sunday, 2 June, 2024
Izzy_blight: Yeah and what I did with that 14 year old "just happened". It's just one of them things
Izzy_blight: actually yeah it kinda was. Nevermind 
Izzy_blight: Anyway I lost my train of thought. Oh yeah i remember what I was thinking. AJ is a cunt. I'm mad
Izzy_blight: Me break jenga blocks
Lazurus: I know your mad hun but you cant be forever sadly I've tried
12:47:24Sunday, 2 June, 2024
Izzy_blight: Just watch me 
Izzy_blight: It's been what feels like centuries already. But uh it's only been like two years...
Izzy_blight: Time flows differently when you're falling apart 
Lazurus: it just feels slow but trust me it flies when you least expect it
Lazurus: hey izz quick question my "friend" sent me this and asked if I wanted it but I'm not a good judge of these things
Izzy_blight: In all that time I resorted to a lot of bad things in desperation to numb the pain. But I had a bomb ticking in my head. No amount of painkillers would disable it. I think back to all those times with AJ. Every conversation I have wasted feels like wasted time. Wasted life. A summer of fun and a lifetime of regret. Oh I'm not a good judge either, I promise I'll make the wrong decision
Lazurus: should I  ask why he sent this to me https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_thumbnail/plain/did:plc:kzl7dhrc7yqskembg6f7p3eq/bafkreicbfqe6secqhqooitzxbfdmpsyl2lto3ngdxvnsykeuivoctejrw4@jpeg
Izzy_blight: Uh yes
Izzy_blight: Yes you should
Lazurus: also why the water bottle
Lazurus: and I'll ask them
Izzy_blight: Size reference i guess?
Izzy_blight: Receiving unsolicited pics like that from friends is certainly... something 
Izzy_blight: Must be some pretty comfortable friends
Dtrump: wwtf
Lazurus: nah we just fuck sometimes is all
Lazurus: trump don't look at that
Dtrump: it has stds
Lazurus: nah he's clean
Dtrump: ugly ass looking cock lol
Lazurus: why do you feel threatened by that thing
Izzy_blight: This has certainly taken a new direction
Dtrump: its not normal looking
Izzy_blight: there are many shapes and sizes 
Lazurus: ikr and no dick is "normal looking"
Dtrump: mine is
Lazurus: proof
Dtrump: woah
Lazurus: I'm joking calm down I still have 13 more days
Izzy_blight: Jimmy has one this big ðŸ¤ and his erection is triangular in a very crooked and horrible sort of way
Lazurus: makes it hit the wrong spots always
Izzy_blight: Jimmys dick is just a disaster
Izzy_blight: Just like his careers 
13:14:13Sunday, 2 June, 2024
Izzy_blight: Feels like I'm spinning my wheels in the shit
Izzy_blight: Does anyone want nudes I'll give them for free
Izzy_blight: I have lost any remaining semblance of self respect 
Lazurus: I'm good hunny and why are you saying these things right now other than boredom or self hatred
Izzy_blight: Don't know. I think those are the reasons
Izzy_blight: I've really gone off the deep end lately
Lazurus: well start swimming hun and not down
Izzy_blight: I don't know how to swim, i tried to learn when I was a kid and almost drowned 
Izzy_blight: Drowning lessons
Lazurus: damn wrong metaphor then
Izzy_blight: Life is an ocean and I can't swim
Izzy_blight: Or maybe I do but I choose to sink out of spite for myself and everything else 
Lazurus: possibly
Lazurus: idk I'm sorry I'm not good at helping ya hun
Izzy_blight: Jimmy purposely tries to drown in swimming pools so that the hot life guards will give him CPR
Izzy_blight: Nobody can help me, don't worry about it 
Lazurus: he only gets the ones with braces
Lazurus: and someone could but I'm not that someone and for that I'm sorry
Izzy_blight: I'm just a sad, attention-seeking whore who gets off on her own misery. I've got some deep-seated issues. But who cares? I'm a lost cause, and the world doesn't need to waste time trying to fix me. Common Jimmy L
Lazurus: you know its not right to think of yourself like that but it is a common problem although for most its life long
Izzy_blight: Thank my dad
Izzy_blight: He was not nice to me 
Lazurus: well you arent easy on yourself either
Izzy_blight: I shouldn't be. I'm not a good person 
Lazurus: you are just maybe not in your eyes
Izzy_blight: I worked with Jimmy at his Palm Beach mansion full of little girls
Izzy_blight: Nah if most people knew the real me they'd want to crucify me, with good reason 
Lazurus: I know how that feels to hate yourself and want to do obscene things to punish yourself but it wont fill any void and it wont help you heal
Lazurus: and if you truly knew me you wouldn't be talking to me rn
Izzy_blight: I don't know, i've hung with some nasty people. Jesus I'm sorry
Izzy_blight: I was hoping I was the only one 
Lazurus: nope sadly
Izzy_blight: The world is sad. It makes me sad ;<
Lazurus: well don't be or ima be sad
13:41:01Sunday, 2 June, 2024
Izzy_blight: Only i should be sad ever. And pedophiles. Give me and pedophiles all of the sadness in the world 
Izzy_blight: Except Jimmy he's the goat
Lazurus: no jimmy fucked the goat
Lazurus: I thought
Izzy_blight: Oh he did do that... it was a little fantasy that involved his grandma, a jar of mayonnaise, and a goat named Gary
Izzy_blight: It could have gone better 
Lazurus: poor gary
Izzy_blight: I didn't know it was possible for goats to get PTSD but he sure did
Izzy_blight: He hasn't stopped shaking since that day
Lazurus: his poor old back
Izzy_blight: Jimmy plays backshot roulette with little girls
Lazurus: pause
Izzy_blight: Jimmy made another trip to Epstein Island (his fifth this week)
Izzy_blight: On an unrelated note Jimmy got arrested for child-related offenses
Izzy_blight: truly shocking
Lazurus: I helped him out of jail so he didn't do me like poor garry
Izzy_blight: He has granted mercy for now but he will be back 
Izzy_blight: With his tiny, unpleasuring, triangular, peanits
Dtrump: huh

Rouge_killer: what
Izzy_blight: Jimmy is a fucked-up nasty fucking fuck. He's a danger to both himself and everyone who lives around him, especially children. His father had a really bad past and was abusive. He raped and beat Jimmy to a pulp and had Jimmy's dog killed in front of him. This caused him to take drugs and was the start of the beginning of his psychosis and delusions, the heroin addiction, violent tendencies, alcoholism, and mental problems.

Dtrump: I don't drink alcohol.
Hello19: Handsy? How so?

Hello19: -_- 
Hello19: Also I had a very fun drink this night

Lazurus: yes what trump said and what did you have
Hello19: I had a sip of a 99 shot left a voodoo ranger which is 7% and a Gatorade because of healthy that's why
Lazurus: that sounds interesting weirdly
Lazurus: I might try it
Hello19: But sadly it didn't even get me buzzed that's why I had another 99 shot which was chocolate flavored with diet coke because of health
Hello19: The sip of 99 was blackberry flavored
Lazurus: yeah those 99 shot aren't really strong I usually just drink vodka and diet coke
Lazurus: it gets the job done
Lazurus: I don't like the blackberry one tbh
Hello19: On my grad night I had a full 99 shot with my ex my sister and her ex my ex was stumbling around after that shot but I was running around crying and shit

Hello19: You should it's fun
Hello19: Hopefully you are the happy drunk not the bad drunk
Lazurus: yeah till the hangover hits you like a bus and yes
Dtrump: I feel if I got drunk I would start groping girls in the bar.
Hello19: I have never had a hang over and never blacked out and I remember everything ðŸ™‚
Hello19: That's why you get drunk by yourself first
Hello19: Also I'm quite nice guy when I'm shitfaced
Hello19: When I get drunk with people I start to care about the people I hanging out with ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤¢
Lazurus: this suckers mid 
Hello19: I have never done anything bad to my ex when I was drunk also when ever something bad did happened around me I would sober up really quickly 
Lazurus: I don't really drink socially so I haven't had those experiences
Hello19: I have they suck I hate interacting with people but that completely goes away when I'm drunkðŸ˜®â€ðŸ’¨ it's weird
Lazurus: I guess you need loosened up before you talk to people
Hello19: Nah

its lesser actually but still
Shinzen: https://www.duden.de/sprachwissen/sprachratgeber/Die-haufigsten-Worter-deutschsprachigen-Texten 
translated:"A closer look at the evaluations reveals some astonishing results: The 100 most frequent words account for almost half of all words in the texts of the Duden corpus.

Shinzen: males are more likely to be big and more males than females are political so yes, "Bignig" is male probably.
Bignig: I AM AN OBESE BLACK WOMAN
Bignig: WAY TO ASSUME WRONG GENIUS
Shinzen: especially compensating with their bigness. A "Biggirl" would more likely marked herself in a nude way in this chat
Shinzen: It needs a way to walk through in the first place.
Bignig: WELL YOU WRONG

Shinzen: He teached Aristotle, which teached Alesander the Great, which Alexander owned 50% of world population at ancient times.
Shinzen: Alexander*
Shinzen: Plato was a student of Socrates, which Socrates walked to public and asked questions to challenge their assumptions. Thats Plato's collab kinda.
Bignig: ALEXANDER WAS HELLA GAY BRUH THIS ALL SUS AF
Shinzen: I admire him for his military skills
Bignig: I ADMIRE MEGAN FOR HER TWERKING SKILLS
Shinzen: Twerking is standard and most women can do it naturally.
Bignig: NAH BRUH GOTTA HAVE DAT ASS
Bignig: EVER SEE A CHICK WITH NO ASS TRY TO TWERK?
Bignig: CRINGE
Bignig: LIKE DAAAYYYYUM GURL GET A BBL
Shinzen: You will know it better about that topic.
Shinzen: https://bloomsies.com/why-cant-i-twerk-unveiling-the-science-behind-twerking/ : "Twerking primarily involves the movement of the buttocks, lower back, and hips. These coordinated motions create the distinct pulsating motion that defines twerking. It requires a synchronized contraction and relaxation of various muscles, including the glutes, hip flexors, and core muscles. Additionally, the ability to isolate different muscle groups and control their movements is crucial."
Shinzen: as a tense guy, I struggle to twerk fluid
Shinzen: Now if I go silence, it is because I have things to do outside.
Bignig: SORRY I WAS TWERKING IN THE MIRROR
Bignig: GODDAMN I STILL GOT IT

Horny: Felt my cock is also in an upward direction lol
Izzy_blight: owo
Horny: Iâ€™m bored asf
Izzy_blight: I'm never bored, I have traumatic memories to keep me occupied for every minute of the day
Izzy_blight: I'm very lucky
Horny: Oof thatâ€™s not great
Izzy_blight: You're telling me 
Izzy_blight: Life's not great. But at least cotton candy exists â¤ðŸŒˆ
Ishipwillowandhunter: Let's fucking go, another day another batch of fresh fucking suffering, just like dad used to make 
Ishipwillowandhunter: .
Izzy_blight: Life is long and god is mean. Suffering in everything 
Ishipwillowandhunter: .
Ishipwillowandhunter: I've been avoiding her. Im scared to talk to her, not because im scared of what will be said but because I know I can't hate her no matter what gets said. They talk about sparks but not the ones that threaten to ignite your soul and burn you down entirely
Izzy_blight: Love is a curse that rends the soul
Ishipwillowandhunter: Im about to make a lot of stupid decisions 
Izzy_blight: Fuck
Ishipwillowandhunter: If I might die tomorrow then I should have some fun tonight 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Even autocorrect is teasing me. Man im a fucking loser
Izzy_blight: What the fuck is going on
Izzy_blight: nasty feeling in my stomach . I feel like I need to something but I don't know what 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Did you see discord? It's explained there. Kinda. Tonight im downing a bottle of wine and when I wake up, im finally fucking doing something
21:04:53Friday, 21 June, 2024
Izzy_blight: What the fuck
Izzy_blight: Jesus Christ what the living fuck no
Izzy_blight: Where's my laptop i need information 
Dtrump: good have fun
Izzy_blight: Trump this is the one and only time I am genuinely irritated at you 
Izzy_blight: Never before or again 
Dtrump: I dont care about anyone on this site.
Izzy_blight: Then what are you doing here
Dtrump: hating
Izzy_blight: I thought you were like the cop
Izzy_blight: The good guy
Ishipwillowandhunter: Wow. Izzy upset with Trump. Never thought I'd see it 
Izzy_blight: I don't know what's going faster my heart or my brain. I feel like I'm going to die
Dtrump: My point stands when I say only three words.
Ishipwillowandhunter: What's funny is seeing the other guy, and all he has, did this. Yes, it hurts unimaginably but my life is so empty. This has no substance. Nothing does. I will be better.
Izzy_blight: Well this fucking sucks
Izzy_blight: Day went from 0 to ruined in two minutes 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I can't help but laugh
Ishipwillowandhunter: It isn't funny
Ishipwillowandhunter: And yet it is
Izzy_blight: Nah fuck that. Not just the day. The month
Izzy_blight: This is just about the least funny thing I can think of 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I get motivated by some fucking cuck and a lying whore lmao
Izzy_blight: Motherfucker
Ishipwillowandhunter: Sorry. I know this hurts you but godddd. I've actually fucking snapped 
Dtrump: am I the cuck
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yes sweetheart 
Ishipwillowandhunter: )c
Izzy_blight: This isn't about me 
Izzy_blight: I am the furthest thing from relevance in this matter 
Izzy_blight: But i have to do something 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Oh but it is. This is hurting you too. Not nearly as much because my mind is fractured and bleeding but still
Izzy_blight: But i can't do anything 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I can. I will.
Izzy_blight: This feeling. It's just like how it was then. My world is coming to an end and I can't stop it yet i know i have to 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I've changed my mind. Im giving myself tomorrow. My mom has important business that would hurt to miss. But tomorrow night, im enjoying myself and then killing myself 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I
Ishipwillowandhunter: I will either be better 
Ishipwillowandhunter: THAN THAT FUCKING CUNT
Ishipwillowandhunter: or I will die
Ishipwillowandhunter: Simple 
Izzy_blight: You had better not die you stupid son of a bitch or im going to follow you into hell and annoy you for eternity 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I should be so lucky 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Don't worry angel, dying isn't the plan. Getting out is.
Izzy_blight: It fucking better be
Izzy_blight: Tyis is like two years ago. The world is too close butt too far away. My head is spinning and heart is exploding. Im going to faint
Izzy_blight: I wish i would to avoid consciousness for a few minutes 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I've been sick all day. I wish I was high. I'd take a fuzzy conscious over this shit
Izzy_blight: My senses are being assault ed on all fronts possible
Izzy_blight: no don't you ever say that 
Izzy_blight: No im sorry 
Izzy_blight: Just i need to take 
Izzy_blight: Ohgod. Fuck. God
Izzy_blight: What do i do want do i do what do I do there's nothing I can do i am  nothing 
Izzy_blight: Just like every time 
Izzy_blight: I know what I need to say. Why can't any of the words get past my mouth. Stupid stupid idiot fucl
Izzy_blight: This is the true nightmare. Tears on the sheets and empty soul
Izzy_blight: I need just one rational thought
Izzy_blight: No i need a fucking team of scientists and engineers and advisors that's what i need 
Izzy_blight: This mess needs professionals to make it useful 
Izzy_blight: It fall s to its knees and weeps for it cannot defend its lot
Izzy_blight: History repeats itself 
Vicgchad07: Barney the Dinosaur getting an anal probe.
Izzy_blight: Everybody dies alone and broken. I cannot stop that
Ishipwillowandhunter: I
Ishipwillowandhunter: Im not sure what's happening 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I've never felt this before 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I feel like my heart's caved in
Ishipwillowandhunter: I can't 
Ishipwillowandhunter: This time im sure
Ishipwillowandhunter: I just CANT. I can't go on like this. 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I can't even shed a single fucking tear despite it all. What's wrong with me 
21:50:39Friday, 21 June, 2024
Ishipwillowandhunter: Suffering falls on deaf ears 
Izzy_blight: Oh to be the only one with functioning eyes and ears in a world of helen kellers
Ishipwillowandhunter: I wish. God. Im so sorry for doing this to you. Give me a second. Im going to brave it and see if my fear turns into something worse 
Izzy_blight: I hereby wish to split formally from the rest of humankind. you are all self absorbed scum
Izzy_blight: Please dont do anything sutpid
Izzy_blight: That's my job 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I did something stupid. Im now angry. How dare she.
Ishipwillowandhunter: I've been blocked. Lmao. Can you imagine? She ruins me and then has the fucking nerve.
Izzy_blight: I can imagine 
Izzy_blight: Whores. Reptilians. Judases. How i loathe them
Ishipwillowandhunter: SHE FUCKING BLOCKED ME. AFTEE EVERYTHING. LYING FOR MONTHS. USING ME TO GET OFF. FUCKING SCUM
Izzy_blight: Uh wait what 
Izzy_blight: Yeah no I'm gonna think about that later. not now. Focus
Izzy_blight: Another little self absorbed cunt never going to get what she deserves. I am so painfully sorry 
Dtrump: hehehhehe
Izzy_blight: If i had a nickel for every time I've seen this exact situation play out id have two nickels. Which isn't a lot but it's fucked that it happened twice 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I have thT movie on DVD
Izzy_blight: Very nice 
Izzy_blight: Lets watch it sometime 
Ishipwillowandhunter: And you know the best part? I finally trusted her enough to give all of me and the very next day, she tells me
Izzy_blight: Why am i lagging im not in the mood for this shit
Izzy_blight: I hgfr
Izzy_blight: I hope that doesn't mean what i think it means 
Izzy_blight: No i need to get ahold of myself

Dtrump: no
Izzy_blight: Okay no no no FUCK this
Izzy_blight: I need a minute 
Izzy_blight: I cant even hold the fucking thingstraight my hands are shaking so bad 
Izzy_blight: My heartbeat is the only sound
Dtrump: heart attack
Ishipwillowandhunter: Yeah 
Ishipwillowandhunter: You're upset 
Ishipwillowandhunter: You're fucking upset
Ishipwillowandhunter: Look at me
Ishipwillowandhunter: Us over 
Ishipwillowandhunter: All of it
Ishipwillowandhunter: FUCK
Izzy_blight: Yes I am being selfish. I never expected better from me. When someone else is suffering i always make it about me 
Izzy_blight: But don't most people 
Izzy_blight: I'm worse than the m though
Izzy_blight: Ow ow fuck
Izzy_blight: Let's hold izzy's delicate little hand and tiptoe around her fragile sensibilities. Boo hoo, she feels uncomfortable. Well cry me a river.
Ishipwillowandhunter: I don't even want to hurt myself right now. I want to hurt everyone else. I have it in me. Yeah honestly I don't give a fuck right now. I see it. You want sympathy. Just like she did. She didn't apologize because she cared, she apologized because she wanted me to care
Izzy_blight: No i know. You're right. I'm sorry
Izzy_blight: I am so sorry about all of that. Not that it will help 
Dtrump: he
Ishipwillowandhunter: Bullshit. Your ears are too stuffed with your own emotions that I doubt you can say sorry towards anyone but yourself. If I had my knife I wouldn't even wait until tomorrow 
Izzy_blight: Please no
Izzy_blight: Yes you're right
Ishipwillowandhunter: I hope I calm down before my parents leave. If not then I am going to have a very bad time.
Izzy_blight: I hope so too so much. Please god
Ishipwillowandhunter: I hate myself even more than her 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Im a goddamn failure 
Izzy_blight: You failed nothing. If anything she failed you. Miserably
Izzy_blight: In a way I can't even imagine 
Ishipwillowandhunter: She meant everything to me at one point 
22:36:25Friday, 21 June, 2024
Ishipwillowandhunter: She talked about 
Ishipwillowandhunter: About a future 
Ishipwillowandhunter: For the first time, I wanted one with a partner 
Dtrump: partimer
Izzy_blight: Sometimes we fall for the wrong person to trust. To love. To idolize. But love is not a choice. And you could never have known who someone really was until they showed you
Izzy_blight: Humans are fickle. Lots of scum out there. But lots of the opposite too. But... sometimes it's hard to tell which is which.
Dtrump: woah Izzy said fickle
Ishipwillowandhunter: I remember saying that. I should've known. I did know. She's been distant for weeks. I knew why. You know what's 
Ishipwillowandhunter: Funny 
Ishipwillowandhunter: I gave her an out
Dtrump: woman are evil
Ishipwillowandhunter: I told her when I noticed the signs that she should just break up with me
Ishipwillowandhunter: You know what she did
Ishipwillowandhunter: She said no, pleaded with me for fucks sake, said she did love me 
Dtrump: Woman grab your balls and twist it.
Izzy_blight: What a snake in the ass. Slimy sidewinder. No qualms about this. None. Despicable
Ishipwillowandhunter: Im getting off. My battery is low and I need to either sleep or suffer in silence 
Izzy_blight: Wishing you the best in this unfathomably difficult time 
Izzy_blight: My arm hurts
Izzy_blight: This can't be good for me but I feel great 
Generic: its dangerous when ur whole life revolves around bein numb
23:22:11Friday, 21 June, 2024
Izzy_blight: Papa Jimbo's All-American Slutfest
Izzy_blight: Oh no, I'm emotionally damaged and psychologically fragile. I sure hope nobody comes along and exploits my vulnerability to achieve their selfish and malicious ends

Especially not sexually, that'd be bad

Izzy_blight: Shit is straight FUCKED yo. On a whole nother level type shit
Craig35: Do you support the monarchy?
Awarenessreply: help
Craig35: do you support the monarchy
Izzy_blight: I support gay marriage
Craig35: Those arent exclusive. You can support constitutional monarchy, which has the highest democratic index and GDP per capita with Monarco, Liechtenstein (almost absolutist) and Luxemburg.
Izzy_blight: I prefer less antiquated forms of government
Izzy_blight: But the noble titles are cool
Craig35: its already modernized like the british and swedish monarchy. The queen delivers stability and constant to talk about generations and connecting them beyond partisan lines. Whats wrong with being timeless and old-fashioned?
Izzy_blight: Some things should stay in the past. Like normalized racism and homophobia. just because they worked then, doesn't mean we need them now. We've moved on to more concrete faiths now. Progress is the natural order of things 
Izzy_blight: Or at least that's what Jimmy would say. But he's dumb so idk
Craig35: They still exist. Good forms in Norway, Liechtenstein and differently in Saudi Arabia and United Emirates for example. Our entire society is build on the past with our memories.
18:01:29Saturday, 22 June, 2024
Izzy_blight: Sure, my house is built on a foundation that was laid over a hundred years ago. But after all that time it's not super stable anymore. It should be updated
Izzy_blight: I'm not saying it's wrong, if good updated versions still exist then that's fine, and honestly props to them for making it work 
Izzy_blight: I'm getting too old for this nonsense 
Izzy_blight: What the hell am i doing here? Am I stupid?
Izzy_blight: Yes ðŸ‘ 
18:47:14Saturday, 22 June, 2024
Craig35: You mean too old to talk about politics or liking monarchy? But else understandable.  Every government form has its own function. I think that a constitutional, classic conservative monarchy can provide stability in polarized times like now. Some tools are forgotten.
18:56:14Saturday, 22 June, 2024
Izzy_blight: Too old to be here every day, doing nothing, pretending that i care about anything that goes on here while i endure unending incomprehensible suffering at the hands of the people i love. Fair

Lazurus: anyone on rn?
Lazurus: I can finally send pics on here
Lazurus: and no ones o plus
Lazurus: on*
Craig35: Do you like the monarchy?
Lazurus: I don't live under one so idk
Craig35: if you want stability and connecting across generatiopns, a King/Queen can help
Lazurus: yes but one or two people with power usually doesn't end well point and case the french
Lazurus: or the empire of japan
Craig35: Which is why I adocate for a constitutional monarchy like in Britain
Lazurus: so public figures of power without absolute power
Craig35: The King/Queen is the immediator between political parties and can intervene when the parliament are in strong disagreement when unity is needed
Lazurus: true but what happens wgen egos and personal agendas come into play
Lazurus: when*
Craig35: that happens in every government. How does democracy account for that?
Lazurus: eh mostly prison time and being barred from public office happens or hush money
Craig35: that happened only once in Netherlands. And the law against insulting the King was removed in 2020. The Queen/King is a human fearing the public and can be useful
Craig35: Oh you mean corruption: The Constitution limits that and the parliament and prime minister can interfer.
Craig35: cmon. The United States is known for legalizing corruption and saying it's a feature. All the partisan partes follows their ego and ideological agenda. This is politics.
Lazurus: yes but it doesn't have to be it just id
Lazurus: is*
Craig35: I argue it mostly leads to lobbyism. One company will gain more money and influence the country more.
Lazurus: true or a complete capitalist take over where the rich starve out the poorer and hold more power in the country than common people
Craig35: all the King does is presenting a constant in our lifes on turbulent, changing times. They are limited to constitution and can represent the commoners few times better when the parliament gridlocks themselves. Like in Covid-times, the Swedish king was against more restrictions. Or Franz Joseph caring about Slovenia in hard times.
Craig35: There's a chance of 50% good and 50% bad ppl coming as a politician regardless.
Lazurus: mmm its like gambling
Craig35: how is democracy less gambling?
Craig35: You can trace the bloodlines and predict exactly whos gonna be the next King/Queen. Execpt the Simpsons and few smart political scientists, noone can predict next US election results.
Craig35: if you talk to strangers, you also gamble and hope this person is more good than bad.
Lazurus: well hope you havent lost your bet because then you'll be in debt
Craig35: like the majority of US students in this capitalist democracy?
Craig35: If you ever rule a country with ppl who never get satisfied, then you can think about it with conservative stances.
Lazurus: is that why the roman empire turned into a church
Craig35: The Roman Empire slitted to half and the 2. half was the Byzatine Empire. Christianity was tolerant to females, so it spread 2x faster than others. Also ppl spread the gospel about an altruistic helper coming from God. idk
Craig35: Germanic tribes, laziness, being to reliant on constant expansion regardless of how much crops their new-gained land will have and other factors are responsible for Rome's downfall.
Craig35: Or do you mean the roman leaders accepting christianity? Basically Jesus's influence was too powerful to ignore.
Dtrump: ha arguing gay
Craig35: Its quite ironic and like how George Bush argued. France and USA at 18th century claiming and democratizing the entire world for the non-westeners's common good. Instead of peacefully transforming into a parliamentary monarchy, the French ppl decided to destroy everything they worked before. Many civil wars for "progress" and "democracy". Yet was it all worth it?
Craig35: Who started the Reign of Terror, Napoleonic Wars, gave breed to Marxism and fascism, atomic bomb, Social Media?
Dtrump: mao 
Craig35: The Great Leap Forward. Yet also in name of progress. The communists also believe in democracy and start elections. With parties that are basically the same but thats still democracy.
Craig35: Monarchy worked for centuries till Louis XIV decided to invest in too many wars. British penal colonies making liberals gathering together in New England too.

Lazurus: why tho :P
Izzy_blight: Because it would make me happy
Izzy_blight: Very happy~
Lazurus: I think I'm good besides I don't like hurting people I like the opposite
Lazurus: why do you want that though
Izzy_blight: Me too. I'm just messing. I am a masochist but not sexually, I just hate myself
Lazurus: ah ok? maybe do something hard that you normally don't do to challenge yourself everyday
Izzy_blight: That would be productive. I don't do productive things. But it sounds great 
Lazurus: well try it and see if it helps if not then back to square one I guess
Dtrump: copre
Lazurus: misspell?
Izzy_blight: I've been at square one and refused to move for like 15 years

Izzy_blight: I have done that sometimes 
Lazurus: ig starting with something simple like reorganizing or cleaning
Izzy_blight: I do have plenty of that to do. I don't know i just feel so tired and apathetic most of the time
Lazurus: I mean if you sleep more you wont feel tired ya know
Izzy_blight: Even when i get a lot of sleep I still look and feel exhausted. My poor diet and frequent masturbation probably doesn't help either 
Dtrump: eat more plants
Lazurus: ig work on your diet first and I didn't need to know that second part
Izzy_blight: More sticks i will eat
Izzy_blight: I can't do that
